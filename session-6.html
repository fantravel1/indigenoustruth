They address systemic reform across child welfare, education, language, health, justice, media, and government. Calls 1 through 5 lead the document because residential schools were fundamentally a child-targeting system. The Calls are not suggestions — they are a survivors' work plan for dismantling the structures that enabled cultural genocide and rebuilding equitable systems. Implementation is the responsibility of federal, provincial, and municipal governments, as well as corporations, schools, hospitals, and every institution in Canada."

As illustrated by the parable 'What about the cow?' — when a thief steals a cow and years later says 'this isn't about the cow' — real reconciliation must address material reality: land, resources, wealth, power, and poverty. It requires equitable funding for Indigenous languages and services, reforming justice and health care systems, implementing Indigenous-designed solutions, and confronting who benefits from ongoing inequity. Education is the foundational lever, as Justice Murray Sinclair stated: the problems began with education, and the cure is education."

They can learn about the treaties that govern the land they live on, support Indigenous language revitalization programs, advocate for equitable funding for Indigenous child welfare and health services, support Indigenous-owned businesses and media, attend public events hosted by Indigenous communities, and hold their elected representatives accountable for implementing the Calls to Action. As Phil Fontaine advises: be open-minded, accept difference with respect, and stay in the work. Reconciliation is not a destination — it is an ongoing commitment to justice."

              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 94 Calls to Action are not bureaucratic recommendations drafted in a boardroom. As Cindy Blackstock emphasizes, they were authored <strong>through survivor testimony</strong> &mdash; "through their tears." Every call carries the weight of lived experience, of children separated from families, of languages silenced, of ceremonies criminalized. The Calls represent the collective voice of those who endured the residential school system and survived to demand change.</p>

              <p>Calls 1 through 5 lead the document deliberately. Residential schools were fundamentally a <strong>child-targeting system</strong>, and the Calls begin with child welfare because that is where the harm was most concentrated and where the crisis continues. When a child in the system asks "how many nights do I see my mom?" &mdash; that is not an abstraction about "overrepresentation." That is the kid's-eye view of a policy failure measured in bedtimes missed, birthdays spent in care, and connections severed.</p>

                <p>Between 1989 and 2011, First Nations children in foster care spent an estimated <strong>66+ million nights away from their families</strong>. These separations were overwhelmingly preventable with equitable, culturally grounded supports &mdash; the very supports the TRC calls for in its opening directives.</p>
              </div>

              <p>The Calls are not aspirational. They are operational. Each one names a specific institution, a specific reform, and a specific outcome. They are, in the truest sense, a work plan &mdash; one designed by the people who knew the system from the inside.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>A common misunderstanding of reconciliation is that it belongs to "the government." But every single one of the 94 Calls to Action is about <strong>systems</strong> &mdash; and systems are not confined to Parliament Hill. Child welfare, justice, education, health, media, the private sector, banks, municipal governments, schools, hospitals: the Calls address the full architecture of Canadian institutional life.</p>

              <p>Indigenous people do not face one system of disadvantage. They face <strong>stacked systems engineered against them</strong> &mdash; child welfare policies that funnel children into care, justice systems that over-incarcerate, health systems that underserve, education systems that erase, and economic systems that exclude. The genius of the 94 Calls is that they address these systems not in isolation but as an interlocking whole.</p>

              <div class="key-concept">
                <span class="key-concept__label">Key Concept</span>
                <h3 class="key-concept__title">Distributed Responsibility</h3>
                <p>Implementation of the Calls to Action is not solely a federal responsibility. Provinces control education and health. Municipalities govern policing and zoning. Corporations shape hiring, procurement, and land use. Universities set curricula. Media outlets decide whose stories are told. Every institution in Canada can locate itself in the 94 Calls and ask: <strong>which of these are mine?</strong></p>
              </div>

              <p>The framework demands that accountability is distributed &mdash; that a hospital in Winnipeg, a school board in Halifax, a law firm in Vancouver, and a mining company in Northern Ontario each recognize their place in the work. Reconciliation is not a federal program. It is a civilizational recalibration.</p>

                <p class="pull-quote__attribution">&mdash; Justice Murray Sinclair, Chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission</p>
              </div>

              <p>Justice Murray Sinclair's formulation is precise: the residential school system was, at its core, an <strong>education system</strong> &mdash; weaponized to destroy identity, language, and family bonds. If education was the instrument of cultural genocide, then education must be the instrument of repair. This is not metaphor. It is strategy.</p>

              <p>And there is progress. Across Canada, curriculum reform is underway. Children are learning about treaties and residential schools from an early age &mdash; information their parents and grandparents were never offered. This is not optional enrichment. It is the baseline literacy required for citizenship in a country built on Indigenous land.</p>

              <div class="key-concept">
                <span class="key-concept__label">Key Concept</span>
                <h3 class="key-concept__title">Reconciliation at the Systems-Wiring Level</h3>
                <p>Meaningful change happens not through one-off lectures or awareness days but through the <strong>structural wiring</strong> of educational institutions. This means language immersion schools growing in number and enrollment. It means universities changing admissions criteria and hiring practices. It means law schools teaching Indigenous law &mdash; as the University of Victoria does through its dual-degree program in Canadian common law and Indigenous legal orders. Reconciliation at the systems-wiring level means that future lawyers, doctors, teachers, and public servants emerge from training with Indigenous knowledge embedded in their professional foundations.</p>
              </div>

              <p>The lever of education works in both directions. When it was used to destroy, it was devastatingly effective. The measure of reconciliation is whether Canada is willing to use it with equal seriousness to rebuild.</p>

              </div>

            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>Language is not merely a communication tool. It carries <strong>customs, history, law, and identity</strong>. Indigenous languages encode legal principles, ecological knowledge, kinship systems, and ceremonial protocols that have no direct translation in English or French. When residential schools punished children for speaking their languages, they were not enforcing linguistic conformity. They were dismantling the infrastructure of sovereignty itself.</p>

              <p>By this measure, the residential school system was disturbingly "successful." Dozens of Indigenous languages are now critically endangered. Elders who carry fluency are aging. Without urgent, funded intervention, entire knowledge systems &mdash; legal, spiritual, ecological &mdash; will be lost within a generation.</p>

                <p>Canada spends approximately <strong>$380 million per year</strong> supporting English and French language programs. Indigenous language revitalization receives roughly <strong>$9 million</strong> &mdash; a ratio of more than 40 to 1. This is not an oversight. It is a policy choice. As advocates have stated plainly: <strong>"If Canada funded it like it mattered, it would survive."</strong></p>

                <h3 class="key-concept__title">Language Sovereignty</h3>
                <p>Language sovereignty means that Indigenous nations have the right and the resources to revitalize, teach, and govern in their own languages. It is not a cultural luxury &mdash; it is the foundation on which self-determination is built. A nation that cannot speak its own law cannot fully govern itself. The 2021 Indigenous Languages Act was a step forward, but without sustained, equitable funding, legislation alone will not reverse generations of deliberate suppression.</p>
              </div>

              <p>Every language lost is not merely a linguistic event. It is the closure of a library, a courtroom, a cathedral, and a pharmacy &mdash; all at once.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>Law is the <strong>strongest system in any society</strong>. It controls behavior, allocates resources, defines rights, and determines consequences. When the legal system discriminates against the first peoples of the land it governs, something is not merely broken &mdash; something is "organically wrong," as the TRC's work revealed.</p>

              <p>The justice-related Calls to Action (25&ndash;42) address over-incarceration, inadequate legal representation, the absence of restorative justice models, and the systemic biases embedded in policing, courts, and corrections. Indigenous people are massively overrepresented in Canadian prisons &mdash; not because of higher rates of criminality, but because of interlocking systems of poverty, displacement, and discriminatory enforcement that funnel them into the criminal justice pipeline.</p>

                <p>The legal profession itself is under-trained for reconciliation. Law schools are only now beginning to integrate Indigenous legal traditions, and the majority of practicing lawyers have no formal education in treaty law, the Doctrine of Discovery, or the constitutional status of Aboriginal rights under Section 35.

                <p class="topic-subtitle">Western medicine treats symptoms; Indigenous healing addresses the whole person</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>There is a fundamental difference between <strong>treatment</strong> and <strong>healing</strong>. Western medicine excels at diagnosing conditions, prescribing interventions, and managing symptoms. Indigenous healing traditions address the <strong>whole person</strong> &mdash; spirit, story, trauma, community, and connection to the land. These are not competing frameworks. They are complementary, and the health care system must learn to hold both.</p>

              <p>Progress is being made. Indigenous patient navigators and Elders are increasingly present in hospitals. British Columbia's First Nations Health Authority represents a groundbreaking model of Indigenous-led health governance. Cultural safety training is expanding. But the system as a whole must still confront the reality of <strong>discriminatory care</strong> &mdash; the documented cases of Indigenous patients receiving inferior treatment, being dismissed by providers, or dying from neglect within the walls of institutions meant to heal them.</p>

                <span class="key-concept__label">Key Concept</span>
                <h3 class="key-concept__title">Restorative Health</h3>
                <p>Restorative health means moving beyond crisis response to <strong>Indigenous-designed prevention</strong>. It means recognizing that health outcomes are shaped by housing, water quality, food security, cultural connection, and self-determination &mdash; not just clinical interventions. It means accountability for discriminatory care, not just training modules. And it means funding Indigenous healing practices with the same institutional respect given to Western medicine.</p>
              </div>

              <p>The health Calls to Action (18&ndash;24) envision a system where Indigenous communities are not patients to be managed but partners in designing the care they receive. A system that treats without healing is a system that manages symptoms while perpetuating the conditions that create them.</p>

            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>Racism is often rooted in <strong>ignorance</strong>, and education is more effective than imposition in dismantling it. But education alone is not enough. Reconciliation must grapple with material reality &mdash; with land, resources, wealth, power, and poverty. It cannot remain in the realm of feelings, apologies, and awareness campaigns.</p>

              <div class="pull-quote">
                <p class="pull-quote__text">What about the cow?</p>
                <p class="pull-quote__attribution">&mdash; Kathleen Makepeace, referencing a South African parable about structural justice</p>
              </div>

              <p>Kathleen's parable from South Africa crystallizes the problem: A thief steals Tabo's cow. Years later, the thief approaches Tabo and says, <strong>"This isn't about the cow."</strong> But of course it is about the cow. Real reconciliation must ask: <strong>Who benefits? Who lost? What is owed? What changes structurally?</strong></p>

              <p>In the Canadian context, the cow is land. The cow is resources. The cow is the wealth generated over centuries from Indigenous territories while Indigenous communities were confined to reserves, denied economic participation, and stripped of governance authority. Symbolic reconciliation without material redress is the thief telling Tabo to move on.</p>

                <p>Structural reconciliation goes beyond acknowledgement. It requires redistribution of resources, restoration of land and governance authority, equitable funding for services, and the redesign of systems that were built on dispossession. It asks every Canadian to consider not only what they feel about reconciliation but what they are willing to change &mdash; in their institutions, their communities, and their own lives.</p>
              </div>

              <p>This is the final session, but it is not the end of the work. The 94 Calls to Action and the 231 Calls for Justice from the MMIWG inquiry remain largely unimplemented. The path forward requires sustained commitment, material investment, and the willingness to sit with uncomfortable truths &mdash; including the truth about the cow.</p>

                <p>The 94 Calls to Action were authored through the testimony of residential school survivors during the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (2009&ndash;2015). They address systemic reform across child welfare, education, language, health, justice, media, and government. Calls 1 through 5 lead the document because residential schools were fundamentally a child-targeting system. The Calls are not suggestions &mdash; they are a survivors' work plan for dismantling the structures that enabled cultural genocide and rebuilding equitable systems. Implementation is the responsibility of federal, provincial, and municipal governments, as well as corporations, schools, hospitals, and every institution in Canada.</p>

                <p>Reconciliation demands structural change, not just symbolic gestures. As illustrated by the parable "What about the cow?" &mdash; when a thief steals a cow and years later says "this isn't about the cow" &mdash; real reconciliation must address material reality: land, resources, wealth, power, and poverty. It requires equitable funding for Indigenous languages and services, reforming justice and health care systems, implementing Indigenous-designed solutions, and confronting who benefits from ongoing inequity. Education is the foundational lever, as Justice Murray Sinclair stated: the problems began with education, and the cure is education.</p>

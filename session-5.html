Unlike Canadian common law, which derives from British parliamentary tradition and relies on codified statutes and judicial precedent, Indigenous legal systems are rooted in relationships with the land, kinship obligations, and collective responsibility. Indigenous law encompasses governance of families, food systems, resource management, dispute resolution, ceremonial practice, and responses to harm. These are not informal customs but sophisticated legal orders that provided safety, predictability, and non-arbitrariness — the same core functions of any legal system. Scholars like John Borrows (Anishinaabe) have documented how Indigenous legal traditions constitute a legitimate third juridical pillar alongside British common law and French civil law in Canada."

          "text": "Restorative justice in Indigenous legal traditions centers the person who was harmed, seeks to understand the context surrounding harmful behaviour without excusing it, requires genuine accountability from the person who caused harm, mobilizes the community as a support and accountability structure, and works to reduce future harm. Practical expressions include sentencing circles where community members participate in determining appropriate responses to wrongdoing, and community-based accountability processes. This approach emerged partly because remote Indigenous communities lacked prison infrastructure and found that sending offenders to distant institutions produced worse outcomes. The 1999 Supreme Court decision in R v. Gladue affirmed the importance of considering Indigenous peoples' unique circumstances in sentencing, recognizing the systemic factors — including residential schools, displacement, and poverty — that contribute to Indigenous overrepresentation in Canadian prisons."

          "text": "The crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) is directly connected to the erasure of Indigenous legal systems. Indigenous law historically placed women in central governance and protective roles. Colonial policies — particularly the Indian Act — systematically stripped Indigenous women of their status, removed them from governance structures, and dismantled the legal systems that protected them. This created conditions where exploitation became normalized and violence against Indigenous women was easier to commit and easier for the state to ignore. The 2019 National Inquiry into MMIWG produced 231 Calls for Justice, yet implementation remains weak. The public debate was often diverted to whether the violence constitutes 'genocide' rather than focusing on actionable responses — itself another form of erasure. Restoring Indigenous legal authority is fundamental to restoring the protections that colonial policy deliberately destroyed."

                <h2 class="topic-title">What Indigenous Law Is</h2>
                <p class="topic-subtitle">A living legal tradition, not "once upon a time"</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>Indigenous law is not folklore. It is not myth dressed in legal language. It is a living legal tradition &mdash; a comprehensive system built to do what all law must do: create safety, ensure predictability, and prevent arbitrary exercises of power. These are the same foundational functions that underpin British common law, French civil law, and every other legal system the world has ever recognized. The difference is that colonialism declared, simply and brutally, <em>"your law doesn't exist."</em></p>

              <p>Indigenous legal systems governed every dimension of community life. They regulated families and kinship obligations. They structured food harvesting, seasonal resource management, and trade relationships that sustained nations across vast territories. They prescribed responsibilities between individuals and communities. They created processes for resolving disputes without destroying relationships. They established ceremonial obligations that connected legal authority to spiritual accountability. They defined responses to harm &mdash; from minor transgressions to existential threats.</p>

              <div class="key-concept">
                <span class="key-concept__label">Key Concept</span>
                <h3 class="key-concept__title">Legal Pluralism</h3>
                <p>Legal pluralism is the recognition that multiple legal systems can coexist within a single political territory. Canada already practices a form of legal pluralism &mdash; British common law governs most provinces while Quebec operates under French civil law. Indigenous legal scholars argue that Indigenous law constitutes a third, equally legitimate juridical tradition. Legal pluralism does not mean legal chaos. It means acknowledging that different communities may have different but equally valid legal foundations for order, accountability, and justice.</p>
              </div>

              <p>The survival argument alone is dispositive. Indigenous societies thrived on this continent for thousands of years &mdash; managing complex governance, trade networks spanning continents, diplomatic alliances, resource stewardship, and multi-generational knowledge systems. No society survives that long without law. The absence of written codification does not mean the absence of legal order. Oral traditions, ceremonial protocols, kinship systems, and council processes <em>were</em> the codification &mdash; transmitted, refined, and enforced across generations with a precision that written systems often fail to match.</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>Indigenous societies could not have survived thousands of years without law. The question was never whether the law existed. The question was whether the colonizers would admit it.</p>
              </blockquote>

              <p>The colonial project required the erasure of Indigenous law because recognition would have demanded consent, negotiation, and co-governance. It was far simpler &mdash; and far more profitable &mdash; to declare a legal vacuum and fill it with British and French systems that served colonial interests exclusively. That erasure was not accidental. It was strategic, and its consequences define Indigenous-state relations to this day.</p>

              <div class="info-card info-card--forest">
                <span class="info-card__label info-card__label--forest">Scholarly Reference</span>
                <p><strong>John Borrows</strong> (Anishinaabe), Canada Research Chair in Indigenous Law at the University of Victoria, has written extensively on the recognition of Indigenous legal orders. His foundational works, including <em>Canada's Indigenous Constitution</em> (2010) and <em>Law's Indigenous Ethics</em> (2019), argue that Indigenous legal traditions are as sophisticated and binding as any Western legal system &mdash; and that Canada's constitutional framework already implicitly supports their recognition.</p>

                <h2 class="topic-title">Why Ignoring Indigenous Law Creates Conflict</h2>
                <p class="topic-subtitle">Imposed structures without legitimacy produce resistance, not order</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>When a legal structure is imposed on a community &mdash; one that does not reflect its values, that lacks legitimacy in the eyes of the people it governs, and that refuses to recognize existing authority &mdash; the result is not compliance. The result is discontent, resistance, escalating confrontation, and deep, generational mistrust of every institution the imposed system produces: police, courts, child welfare, corrections.</p>

              <p>This is not a theoretical problem. It is the lived reality of Indigenous communities across Canada. The "flashpoints" that appear in news coverage &mdash; standoffs, blockades, protests, clashes with police &mdash; are consistently mischaracterized as the actions of "lawless" communities. The framing inverts reality. These flashpoints occur precisely <em>because</em> the state behaves as though only one legal tradition counts &mdash; its own &mdash; and treats any assertion of Indigenous legal authority as illegitimate, criminal, or at best, ceremonial.</p>

              <div class="pull-quote">
                <p class="pull-quote__text">The root of every flashpoint is not that communities are lawless. It is that the state acts like only one law counts.</p>
              </div>

              <p>Consider what happens when a community has a sophisticated internal system for managing land use, resource access, family governance, and dispute resolution &mdash; and then an external authority arrives, declares that system nonexistent, and substitutes its own rules without consultation or consent. Every interaction between that community and the imposed system becomes an act of erasure. Every police encounter, every court proceeding, every child welfare investigation reinforces the message: <em>your order does not matter.</em></p>

              <p>The resulting mistrust is not irrational. It is the predictable, rational response to a system that has never earned legitimacy and continues to refuse the recognition that might begin to build it. Until Canada engages with Indigenous law as a legitimate legal tradition rather than a cultural artifact, the conflict is structurally guaranteed to continue.</p>

              <div class="info-card info-card--warning">
                <span class="info-card__label info-card__label--warning">Structural Pattern</span>
                <p>The cycle is self-reinforcing: the state imposes law without legitimacy, communities resist or disengage, the state responds with enforcement, enforcement deepens mistrust, mistrust produces further disengagement, and the state characterizes disengagement as dysfunction. At no point in this cycle does the state question the legitimacy of its own imposition. The problem is always located in the community, never in the structure.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>One of the most revealing aspects of Indigenous legal traditions is that many communities did not use the word "law" to describe their systems of order. They did not need to. The principles were so deeply embedded in daily life, kinship structures, ceremonial practice, and community governance that they were simply <em>how people lived</em>. The absence of the European label did not indicate the absence of the European function.</p>

              <p>On reserves, the RCMP presence was often minimal and narrowly focused. Police involvement was largely limited to alcohol-related incidents, murder, and certain assaults. Beyond those categories, policing was more symbol than system. The RCMP officer was a presence, not a pervasive force. Community order was maintained through internal mechanisms: elder authority, kinship accountability, ceremonial obligation, and social consequences that did not require handcuffs or holding cells.</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>We didn't call it law &mdash; it was just how we lived. But make no mistake: there were rules, there were consequences, and there was accountability. We didn't need a courthouse to have justice.</p>
              </blockquote>

              <p>This arrangement reveals something important about how Indigenous communities understood the role of external enforcement. Communities did not reject the concept of order &mdash; they managed harm strategically. Many communities expected the Crown to enforce alcohol prohibition, not because they were deferring to colonial authority, but because they recognized alcohol as a destabilizing weapon introduced through the colonial encounter. They were pragmatic: use the colonizer's enforcement capacity against the colonizer's most destructive import.</p>

              <p>This strategic engagement with external law enforcement demonstrates sophisticated legal reasoning. Indigenous communities were not passive recipients of colonial authority. They were active participants in a complex legal landscape, drawing on both their own traditions and the imposed system as circumstances required. The narrative of communities without law collapses entirely under this evidence.</p>

                <p class="topic-subtitle">Centering the harmed, mobilizing the community, reducing future harm</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>Restorative justice is perhaps the most widely recognized feature of Indigenous legal traditions, and for good reason. It represents a fundamentally different philosophy from the punitive model that dominates Canadian criminal law. Where the state system asks "what law was broken, who broke it, and what punishment do they deserve?", restorative justice asks a different set of questions entirely: Who was harmed? What do they need? What caused this behaviour? How do we hold the person accountable <em>and</em> restore the community?</p>

              <div class="key-concept">
                <span class="key-concept__label">Key Concept</span>
                <h3 class="key-concept__title">Restorative Justice</h3>
                <p>Restorative justice is an approach to harm that centers the needs of the person who was harmed, seeks to understand the context surrounding the harmful behaviour without excusing it, requires genuine accountability from the person who caused harm, mobilizes the community as a support and accountability structure, and works to reduce future harm. It is not "soft on crime" &mdash; it demands more from offenders than a prison cell ever does, because it requires them to face the people they harmed and do the work of repair.</p>
              </div>

              <p>Sentencing circles are the most visible expression of this approach. In a sentencing circle, community members &mdash; including elders, family members of both the harmed person and the person who caused harm, and other community stakeholders &mdash; participate directly in determining the appropriate response. This is not a symbolic exercise. It is a legal process in which the community exercises genuine authority over outcomes.</p>

              <p>The practical origins of restorative justice in Indigenous communities are instructive. Remote communities often lacked prison infrastructure entirely. When someone committed a serious offence, the options were limited: deal with them locally or send them south to a distant institution. Communities observed, consistently, that sending people away produced worse outcomes. People returned more damaged, more alienated, and more likely to reoffend. The community-based approach was not born from idealism &mdash; it was born from pragmatic observation of what actually worked.</p>

                <p class="legal-precedent__citation">Supreme Court of Canada, [1999] 1 SCR 688</p>
                <p>The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that sentencing judges must consider the unique systemic and background factors affecting Indigenous peoples when determining sentences. The decision recognized that the overrepresentation of Indigenous people in Canadian prisons is not a statistical anomaly but a direct consequence of colonialism, residential schools, displacement, and systemic discrimination. The Gladue decision created a framework for courts to consider restorative justice alternatives and community-based sentencing for Indigenous offenders &mdash; formally acknowledging that the standard punitive model fails Indigenous communities in measurable, documented ways.</p>
              </div>

              <p>The Gladue principles do not excuse harmful behaviour. They require courts to understand it in context &mdash; to recognize that a person's trajectory through the criminal justice system may have begun not with a personal moral failing but with a residential school, a foster care placement, a community shattered by policy, or a lifetime of encounters with a system that treated them as a problem to be managed rather than a person to be served.</p>

              <p>Indigenous people represent approximately five percent of Canada's population but account for over thirty percent of the federal prison population. Among women, the disproportion is even starker. This is not a coincidence, and it is not explained by higher rates of criminality.

              <p>The mechanisms are layered and mutually reinforcing. Racial profiling increases the likelihood of police contact. Poverty and lack of resources make it impossible to meet bail conditions. Geographic remoteness creates transportation barriers that lead to missed court appearances, which stack as "failure to appear" charges &mdash; each one compounding the next, transforming a minor initial charge into an escalating legal crisis. Trauma produces substance use, which produces behaviour that the system classifies as criminal, which produces incarceration, which produces more trauma. Prison becomes, in the words repeated across communities, "the university of institutions."</p>

              <div class="pull-quote">
                <p class="pull-quote__text">That's not a moral theory. That's a pipeline.</p>
              </div>

              <p>But the deepest root is the residential school system and its generational consequences. Follow the trajectory: children taken from families, raised in institutions defined by lovelessness and fear-based discipline, where violence was normalized as a method of control. Those children grow into adults without parenting models, without the emotional vocabulary that family attachment provides, without the community support systems that were deliberately dismantled. That instability produces substance use as a coping mechanism. Substance use produces contact with the criminal justice system. The criminal justice system produces incarceration. Incarceration produces further alienation, further trauma, further separation from children &mdash; and the cycle repeats in the next generation.</p>

              <p>This is not a moral failing on the part of individuals caught in the system. It is a structural failure on the part of the system that built the pipeline. Understanding this distinction is not about excusing harmful behaviour &mdash; it is about understanding why the standard punitive response to that behaviour makes things worse rather than better, and why Indigenous communities have long advocated for approaches that address root causes rather than symptoms.</p>

              <p>When discussions turn to reforming the justice system, to reducing Indigenous overrepresentation in prisons, to building more equitable legal structures &mdash; Canada consistently looks outward. International models are studied. Scandinavian approaches are admired. Reports are commissioned, experts are consulted, and conferences are convened. All of this while the most relevant, most tested, most contextually appropriate solutions are already here, embedded in the legal traditions of First Nations.</p>

              <p>Canada already knows how to operate a multi-juridical system. It has done so since Confederation. British common law governs nine provinces and three territories. French civil law governs Quebec. The two systems coexist, overlap in certain domains, and operate independently in others. The constitutional framework accommodates this duality without crisis. The sky has not fallen because Quebec has a different legal foundation than Ontario.</p>

                <h3 class="key-concept__title">Multi-Juridical Canada</h3>
                <p>Canada is often described as bi-juridical &mdash; a country with two legal traditions (British common law and French civil law). But this description is incomplete. Indigenous legal traditions constitute a third juridical pillar that predates both European imports by millennia. Canada is not bi-juridical but multi-juridical. The resistance to recognizing this third pillar is not legal or constitutional &mdash; it is political. The framework for accommodation already exists. What is missing is the political will to extend it.</p>
              </div>

              <p>The argument for Indigenous legal recognition is not radical. It is consistent with Canada's existing constitutional architecture. Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 recognizes and affirms existing Aboriginal and treaty rights. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), adopted into Canadian law, affirms the right of Indigenous peoples to maintain and strengthen their own juridical systems. The legal groundwork is laid. The scholarly foundation is built. The community capacity exists. What remains missing is the political commitment to treat Indigenous law as law &mdash; not as culture, not as tradition, not as ceremony, but as <em>law</em>.</p>

                <p class="topic-subtitle">When the threat is existential, the response matches the stakes</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>Indigenous legal traditions are sometimes caricatured as exclusively gentle &mdash; all talking circles and reconciliation. This misrepresents both the sophistication and the seriousness of these systems. Like every legal tradition in human history, Indigenous law included provisions for the most extreme circumstances: when a person constituted a lethal, irredeemable threat to the community.</p>

              <p>The Windigo concept illustrates this dimension of Indigenous law. In multiple Algonquian-speaking nations, the Windigo represents a being consumed by insatiable, destructive appetite &mdash; a metaphor for the person who has become so dangerous that they threaten the survival of the community itself. When someone was identified as a Windigo &mdash; a person whose behaviour had become lethal and who could not be rehabilitated &mdash; the community's legal response could include the ultimate sanction: removing that threat permanently. This was not vigilantism. It was a legal determination made by the community through its governing structures, grounded in the principle that the survival of the many cannot be sacrificed to the preservation of the one.</p>

              <p>Banishment represents a related but distinct remedy. When an individual's behaviour made them dangerous to the community but not necessarily lethal, banishment &mdash; removal from the community and its territory &mdash; served as the response. This is not a historical curiosity. Banishment is resurfacing in contemporary Indigenous governance through band council bylaws. Communities are using their limited self-governance authority to remove individuals who pose ongoing threats, particularly in the context of drug trafficking and violent behaviour.</p>

              <div class="info-card info-card--highlight">
                <span class="info-card__label info-card__label--highlight">Contemporary Application</span>
                <p>Several First Nations have enacted banishment bylaws to remove individuals involved in drug trafficking or persistent violence from their communities. Canadian courts have begun to engage with these orders, and some have been upheld as legitimate exercises of Indigenous governance authority. However, the effectiveness of banishment requires enforcement capacity &mdash; specifically, community-controlled policing with the authority and resources to implement banishment orders. Without this capacity, banishment remains a legal determination without operational teeth.</p>
              </div>

              <p>These extreme remedies demonstrate that Indigenous law was never naive about human nature. It recognized that restorative approaches work for most situations &mdash; and that some situations require more decisive action. The legal framework included the full spectrum of responses, calibrated to the severity of the threat. The notion that Indigenous communities lacked enforcement mechanisms is a colonial fiction contradicted by the historical and contemporary evidence.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>The phrase "rule of law" carries enormous weight in Canadian political discourse. It is invoked to justify enforcement actions against Indigenous communities, to frame blockades and protests as illegitimate, and to position the Canadian legal system as the only legitimate source of order. But the history of "law" in what became Canada tells a very different story &mdash; one where law was indistinguishable from corporate power and where justice was whatever served the interests of profit.</p>

              <p>The Hudson's Bay Company, chartered in 1670, was granted by the English Crown not just trading rights but governing authority over a territory the Crown had no legitimate claim to and had never surveyed. The Company administered "justice" in this territory for two centuries. That justice was harsh, summary, and violent. It was not designed to protect communities or ensure fairness. It was designed to maintain corporate control over the fur trade and to discipline anyone &mdash; particularly Indigenous people &mdash; who threatened that control.</p>

              <div class="primary-source">
                <span class="primary-source__label">Historical Context</span>
                <h3 class="primary-source__title">Hudson's Bay Company Charter (1670)</h3>
                <p class="primary-source__meta">Royal Charter granted by King Charles II</p>
                <p class="primary-source__text">The HBC charter granted the Company absolute proprietary rights and governing authority over "Rupert's Land" &mdash; 1.5 million square miles of territory, encompassing the entire Hudson Bay watershed. The Company was empowered to make laws, impose penalties, administer justice, and maintain armed forces. For Indigenous peoples living on this land for millennia, their existing legal orders were nullified by a document signed in London by a monarch who had never set foot on the continent.</p>
              </div>

              <p>Company justice included execution. When it suited corporate interests to make an example of someone, the Company executed them. These were not judicial proceedings in any meaningful sense. They were demonstrations of power dressed in the language of law. And they were disproportionately directed at Indigenous people, who were simultaneously essential to the Company's economic model and subordinated within its legal framework.</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>When someone tells you that "rule of law" is the foundation of Canadian order, ask them whose law, and whose order. The history of law in this country begins with a corporation executing people to protect its profit margins.</p>
              </blockquote>

              <p>This history matters because it reveals the hollowness of appeals to "rule of law" when directed at Indigenous communities. The "law" that was imposed on Indigenous peoples was not a neutral framework for justice. It was a tool of extraction, control, and violence. When Indigenous communities express suspicion of the legal system, they are not being irrational. They are remembering accurately.</p>

              <p>The crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls is not an isolated phenomenon.

              <p>Follow the chain of causation. Indigenous legal systems placed women in central governance and protective roles. Colonial policy &mdash; particularly the Indian Act &mdash; systematically removed women from those roles. The Indian Act stripped Indigenous women of their status when they married non-Indigenous men (a provision with no equivalent for Indigenous men). It excluded women from band governance. It imposed patriarchal structures on nations that had been matrilineal or matrilocal for centuries. With each policy intervention, the legal protections surrounding Indigenous women were weakened, and the cultural norms that reinforced those protections were eroded.</p>

              </div>

              <p>The fundamental question posed by both the TRC and the MMIWG Inquiry is deceptively simple: <em>if we accept the truth, what do we do with it?</em> The truth has been documented. The mechanisms of harm have been identified. The pathways to repair have been prescribed. The question is no longer one of knowledge &mdash; it is one of will.</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>The truth has been told. The calls have been made. The question that remains is whether Canada will treat Indigenous law as law, Indigenous justice as justice, and Indigenous lives as lives. Everything else is commentary.</p>
              </blockquote>

              <p>Recognizing Indigenous legal traditions is not a symbolic gesture. It is a structural necessity. Without it, the justice system will continue to produce the outcomes it was designed to produce: Indigenous overrepresentation in prisons, Indigenous underrepresentation in governance, and the ongoing erasure of legal traditions that offered &mdash; and still offer &mdash; a more effective, more humane, and more accountable approach to justice than the model Canada has imposed.</p>

                What is Indigenous law and how does it differ from Canadian common law?
              </button>
              <div class="faq-answer" role="region">
                <p>Indigenous law is a living legal tradition that has governed Indigenous societies for thousands of years. Unlike Canadian common law, which derives from British parliamentary tradition and relies on codified statutes and judicial precedent, Indigenous legal systems are rooted in relationships with the land, kinship obligations, and collective responsibility. Indigenous law encompasses governance of families, food systems, resource management, dispute resolution, ceremonial practice, and responses to harm. These are not informal customs but sophisticated legal orders that provided safety, predictability, and non-arbitrariness &mdash; the same core functions of any legal system. Scholars like John Borrows (Anishinaabe) have documented how Indigenous legal traditions constitute a legitimate third juridical pillar alongside British common law and French civil law in Canada.</p>

                How does restorative justice work in Indigenous legal traditions?
              </button>
              <div class="faq-answer" role="region">
                <p>Restorative justice in Indigenous legal traditions centers the person who was harmed, seeks to understand the context surrounding harmful behaviour without excusing it, requires genuine accountability from the person who caused harm, mobilizes the community as a support and accountability structure, and works to reduce future harm. Practical expressions include sentencing circles where community members participate in determining appropriate responses to wrongdoing. This approach emerged partly because remote Indigenous communities lacked prison infrastructure and found that sending offenders to distant institutions produced worse outcomes. The 1999 Supreme Court decision in R v. Gladue affirmed the importance of considering Indigenous peoples' unique circumstances in sentencing, recognizing the systemic factors that contribute to Indigenous overrepresentation in Canadian prisons.</p>

                What is the connection between Indigenous law and the MMIWG crisis?
              </button>
              <div class="faq-answer" role="region">
                <p>The crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls is directly connected to the erasure of Indigenous legal systems. Indigenous law historically placed women in central governance and protective roles. Colonial policies &mdash; particularly the Indian Act &mdash; systematically stripped Indigenous women of their status, removed them from governance structures, and dismantled the legal systems that protected them. This created conditions where exploitation became normalized and violence against Indigenous women was easier to commit and easier for the state to ignore. The 2019 National Inquiry into MMIWG produced 231 Calls for Justice, yet implementation remains weak. Restoring Indigenous legal authority is fundamental to restoring the protections that colonial policy deliberately destroyed.</p>

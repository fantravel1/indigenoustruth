It provided the legal justification for colonization, dispossession, and the enslavement of Indigenous peoples. It still matters because it was codified into common law through Johnson v. M'Intosh (1823) and continues to underpin Crown land ownership claims in Canada. The principle that Indigenous peoples hold only 'occupancy rights' rather than full sovereignty traces directly to this doctrine."

It explicitly acknowledged that Indigenous peoples held rights to their lands and established that only the Crown could purchase Indigenous territory — and only through formal negotiation and treaty. It is called the 'Indian Magna Carta' because it represented the first formal recognition by a European power that Indigenous peoples had inherent land rights that could not simply be seized. The Proclamation remains constitutionally significant: it was embedded into Section 25 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982, and it serves as a foundation for modern Aboriginal title claims."

              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>Every meaningful discussion about Canadian history must begin with a land acknowledgement -- not as performative ritual, but as an act of historical and legal honesty. Canada, as a political entity, exists on Indigenous land. Much of this land was never surrendered through treaty, never purchased, and never legitimately transferred. The territories of nations such as the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh in what is now called British Columbia remain unceded, meaning no treaty or agreement was ever signed transferring sovereignty or ownership to the Crown.</p>

              <p>A land acknowledgement is not a symbolic gesture -- it is a framing device. It establishes who was here first, whose laws governed these lands, and whose relationship with the land extends back millennia. When we skip this step, we implicitly accept the colonial narrative that Canada began with European "discovery." The acknowledgement disrupts that narrative at its root. It forces us to confront the fact that the institutions, cities, and legal systems built on this land were constructed atop existing nations with their own governance, trade networks, spiritual practices, and territorial boundaries.</p>

              <p>Legally, the distinction between ceded and unceded territory carries enormous weight. On unceded land, Indigenous nations retain their inherent rights and title. This is not a matter of opinion or goodwill -- it is a legal reality affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in decisions like <em>Tsilhqot'in Nation v. British Columbia</em> (2014). Understanding this context transforms everything that follows in this session: every treaty, every act of dispossession, every legal doctrine discussed here rests on the question of who holds rightful title to the land.</p>

                <p>Land that was never surrendered, sold, or transferred to the Crown through any treaty, agreement, or other lawful mechanism. In Canadian law, unceded territory means Indigenous nations retain Aboriginal title -- their inherent right to use and control the land. Significant portions of British Columbia, Quebec, and the Maritimes remain unceded.</p>

                <p class="topic-subtitle">Written colonial history versus oral Indigenous knowledge</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>The history of what is now called Canada depends entirely on who is telling it. The dominant colonial narrative begins with European "discovery" -- Jacques Cartier arriving in 1534, Samuel de Champlain founding Quebec in 1608, the gradual extension of French and then British sovereignty over a supposedly empty or under-utilized land. This narrative treats European arrival as the starting point of history, reducing everything prior to a footnote, a preamble to the "real" story of nation-building.</p>

              <p>Indigenous oral histories tell a radically different story. Indigenous peoples have lived on these lands since time immemorial -- a phrase that is not poetic exaggeration but a deliberate assertion of deep temporal continuity. Archaeological evidence supports continuous habitation stretching back at least 14,000 years, with some sites suggesting human presence even earlier. But Indigenous self-understanding does not depend on Western archaeological validation. Oral traditions describe creation on these lands, an unbroken relationship with specific territories, and governance systems that predate any European contact by thousands of years.</p>

              <p>The Bering Strait theory -- the hypothesis that all Indigenous peoples migrated from Asia across a land bridge -- is a Western scientific framework. While it may describe one migration pathway, it is not part of Indigenous self-understanding. Many nations' oral histories describe creation on Turtle Island itself. The insistence on the Bering Strait narrative as the only "true" origin story reveals a deeper bias: the European assumption that "written" equals "true" and "oral" equals "myth." This hierarchy of knowledge systems was used to dismiss Indigenous history, law, and governance as primitive or unreliable, justifying the imposition of European systems over Indigenous ones.</p>

                <p class="key-concept__label">Key Concept</p>
                <h3 class="key-concept__title">Oral Tradition as Historical Record</h3>
                <p>Indigenous oral traditions are not folklore or legend. They are sophisticated systems of knowledge transmission, refined over thousands of years, that encode history, law, ecological knowledge, territorial boundaries, and governance principles. The Supreme Court of Canada recognized the legal weight of oral history in <em>Delgamuukw v. British Columbia</em> (1997), ruling that oral histories must be placed on equal footing with written documents in Canadian courts. The dismissal of oral tradition as inferior to written records is itself a colonial act.</p>

                <p class="topic-subtitle">Irreconcilable frameworks for understanding land, life, and belonging</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>Before any treaty was signed, any battle was fought, or any law was imposed, the fundamental collision between Indigenous and European peoples was cosmological. The two civilizations held irreconcilable views about the nature of land, the relationship between humans and the natural world, and the meaning of sovereignty. Understanding this spiritual and philosophical divide is essential to understanding everything that followed.</p>

              <p>Indigenous cosmologies -- while extraordinarily diverse across hundreds of nations -- share a core principle: the land is sacred, alive, and relational. In Ojibwe tradition, the trickster-teacher Nanabush shaped the world and all its beings, establishing relationships of reciprocity between humans, animals, plants, water, and land. The land was not a commodity; it was a relative. You could no more "own" the land than you could own the wind or the sky. Governance was about maintaining balance and fulfilling responsibilities to the land and all its inhabitants. This worldview produced sophisticated land management practices, including controlled burns, sustainable harvesting, and seasonal rotation patterns that maintained ecological health for millennia.</p>

              <p>European cosmologies, rooted in Judeo-Christian theology and increasingly in Enlightenment rationalism, framed land as a resource to be claimed, owned, and extracted from. The Book of Genesis granted dominion over the earth; emerging notions of private property and mercantile economics turned land into a fungible asset. When Jacques Cartier planted a cross at Gaspe in 1534, he was not merely performing a symbolic religious act. He was executing a legal claim of possession under the Doctrine of Discovery -- asserting that the land now belonged to the French Crown because its inhabitants were non-Christian. The cross was simultaneously a religious symbol and a legal instrument of dispossession.</p>

              <p>This clash of worldviews was not a misunderstanding that better communication could have resolved. It was a fundamental incompatibility between two ways of being in the world. The European framework demanded ownership, extraction, and hierarchy; the Indigenous framework demanded reciprocity, responsibility, and relationship. The colonial project required the suppression of Indigenous cosmologies -- not because they were inferior, but because they were incompatible with the economic and political goals of empire.</p>

                <p>When Cartier planted the cross at Gaspe Bay in 1534, Chief Donnacona immediately protested, understanding the act as a claim of possession.

              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>The Doctrine of Discovery is the legal and theological framework that made European colonization of the Americas possible. It is not an abstract historical relic -- it is the legal foundation upon which Crown land ownership in Canada still rests. Understanding its origins, its evolution into common law, and its continued relevance is essential to grasping why Indigenous land rights remain contested today.</p>

              <p>The doctrine originated in a series of Papal Bulls -- formal decrees issued by the Catholic Pope. In 1452, Pope Nicholas V issued <em>Dum Diversas</em>, authorizing King Alfonso V of Portugal to "invade, search out, capture, vanquish, and subdue" all non-Christians, to "reduce their persons to perpetual slavery," and to "take all their possessions and property." In 1455, <em>Romanus Pontifex</em> expanded this authority, granting Portugal exclusive rights to territories along the West African coast and beyond. In 1493, following Columbus's first voyage, Pope Alexander VI issued <em>Inter Caetera</em>, dividing the non-Christian world between Spain and Portugal, granting Spain sovereignty over virtually the entire Western Hemisphere.</p>

              <p>These were not merely religious pronouncements. They established a legal framework under which non-Christian peoples were deemed inferior, non-sovereign, and enslavable. Their lands could be claimed by Christian monarchs simply by "discovering" them -- that is, by being the first Christian to set foot on them. The rights, governance systems, and territorial sovereignty of the peoples already living on these lands were rendered legally invisible.</p>

              <p>The Doctrine of Discovery did not remain in the 15th century. In 1823, the United States Supreme Court codified it into Anglo-American common law in <em>Johnson v. M'Intosh</em>. Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that "discovery gave title to the government" and that Indigenous peoples retained only a "right of occupancy" that could be extinguished by the discovering nation. This ruling -- which explicitly cited the Papal Bulls as its legal foundation -- became binding precedent in both American and Canadian law. It remains the basis upon which Crown land title is asserted in Canada today.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>One of the most aggressively erased facts in Canadian history is this: European colonists would not have survived without Indigenous peoples. The narrative of rugged European settlers taming a wild land is a myth. In reality, early European arrivals were profoundly dependent on Indigenous knowledge, food systems, medicine, transportation technology, and diplomatic networks for their very survival.</p>

              <p>The most famous example is Jacques Cartier's second voyage in 1535-1536. During the winter at Stadacona (present-day Quebec City), Cartier's crew was devastated by scurvy. Twenty-five men died, and nearly all the rest were critically ill. The expedition was on the verge of total collapse when the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) showed them how to make a tea from the bark and needles of the white cedar tree (<em>annedda</em>), rich in vitamin C. The crew recovered rapidly. Cartier himself recorded this in his journal, acknowledging that Indigenous knowledge had saved his men. Yet within a generation, the French were treating these same peoples as subjects to be governed.</p>

              <p>This pattern repeated itself across the continent. European settlements at Quebec, Port-Royal, and elsewhere survived their early years only because Indigenous peoples shared food during harsh winters, taught agricultural techniques suited to the local climate, provided knowledge of waterways and overland routes, and served as diplomatic intermediaries with other nations. The entire colonial infrastructure -- from fur trading posts to military alliances -- was built on Indigenous expertise and cooperation. The subsequent narrative of European self-sufficiency and Indigenous dependency is a complete inversion of the historical record.</p>

                <p>Standard Canadian history textbooks often present European settlement as a story of pioneering independence. The historical record shows the opposite: colonial survival depended on Indigenous food systems, medicine, navigation, and diplomacy. Recognizing this dependency is not a minor correction -- it fundamentally reframes who was the advanced civilization and who was the newcomer struggling to survive.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>The fur trade was the economic foundation of colonial Canada for nearly two centuries. It shaped settlement patterns, drove European exploration, determined military alliances, and generated the wealth that funded further colonization. But there is a critical fact that colonial narratives consistently obscure: the fur trade could not have existed without Indigenous peoples. They were not passive participants or junior partners -- they were the trade's essential workforce, its knowledge base, its transportation system, and its diplomatic infrastructure.</p>

              <p>Indigenous men were the trappers who possessed generations of ecological knowledge about animal populations, seasonal patterns, and sustainable harvesting practices. Indigenous women processed the furs, built and repaired birchbark canoes -- the only vessels capable of navigating the vast inland waterway networks -- and produced pemmican and other preserved foods that sustained trading expeditions. Indigenous peoples served as navigators across territories that European traders could not traverse alone, as interpreters across dozens of languages, and as diplomats who maintained the complex web of alliances that made trade possible.</p>

              <p>The Hudson's Bay Company, chartered in 1670, is often presented as a great British commercial enterprise. In reality, the HBC was a shell that depended entirely on Indigenous labor and knowledge. European traders sat in forts at river mouths; Indigenous peoples did the actual work of trapping, processing, transporting, and trading furs across vast distances. Without Indigenous participation, the HBC would have been an empty charter and a few abandoned wooden forts. The later romanticization of the fur trade as a story of European enterprise erased this fundamental dependency and the exploitative terms under which Indigenous labor was increasingly extracted.</p>

                <p class="pull-quote__text">The Hudson's Bay Company did not build the fur trade. Indigenous peoples built it. The Company simply inserted itself into networks that had existed for centuries.</p>

                <p>Indigenous women were central to the fur trade's success. Beyond processing furs and making pemmican, they served as cultural intermediaries through intermarriage with European traders, creating kinship networks that facilitated diplomacy and trade. The Metis nation emerged from these unions, forming a distinct people with their own language (Michif), governance, and culture.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>Alcohol -- what came to be called "firewater" -- was unknown to Indigenous peoples in most of North America before European contact. There was no cultural framework for its use, no established practices for moderation, and no biological history of exposure. European traders understood this and exploited it deliberately, using alcohol as a tool to create dependency, manipulate trade negotiations, enforce debt obligations, and undermine Indigenous self-governance.</p>

              <p>The mechanics were straightforward and predatory. Traders would offer alcohol freely to establish desire for it, then use it as a trade commodity once dependency was established. Indigenous trappers would be encouraged to drink on credit, accumulating debts that could only be repaid through continued trapping at terms favorable to the trader. Alcohol was introduced at the beginning of trade negotiations to impair judgment, ensuring that Indigenous leaders agreed to exchanges that were grossly disadvantageous. The result was a cycle of dependency, debt, and dispossession that served the economic interests of the colonial trade system.</p>

              <p>The term "firewater" itself carries this history. It derives from Indigenous observations of alcohol's properties -- specifically, the fact that high-proof spirits would ignite when spilled near a flame. The word entered English and French from various Indigenous languages as a descriptor of this strange, flammable liquid that altered consciousness and behavior. Over time, the term was turned back against Indigenous peoples as a stereotype, used to portray them as inherently vulnerable to alcohol rather than as victims of its deliberate weaponization. The true story is not about Indigenous weakness but about colonial strategy: alcohol was a tool of empire, deployed with full knowledge of its destructive effects.</p>

                <p>The introduction of alcohol into the fur trade was not accidental or incidental. It followed the same pattern used by European colonial powers globally: introduce a substance that creates dependency, then use that dependency to extract labor, resources, and territorial concessions. This pattern would be repeated with other commodities and policies throughout the colonial period, always with the goal of undermining Indigenous autonomy and self-sufficiency.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>The Christianization of Indigenous peoples was never a purely spiritual endeavor. From the earliest days of contact, evangelization served as the cultural arm of colonial expansion, working in concert with military force and commercial exploitation to dismantle Indigenous societies from the inside. The missionaries who arrived in New France and later in British North America understood that converting Indigenous peoples to Christianity meant more than changing their beliefs -- it meant restructuring their family systems, governance, gender relations, and relationship with the land.</p>

              <p>The Jesuit order, in particular, approached evangelization with strategic precision. Jesuits learned Indigenous languages, sometimes with remarkable fluency, specifically to gain access to communities and influence from within. They documented Indigenous cultures in extraordinary detail through the <em>Jesuit Relations</em> -- annual reports sent back to France -- not out of respect for those cultures but to understand them well enough to dismantle them. The Jesuits targeted children, sought to undermine the authority of traditional leaders and spiritual practitioners, and worked to replace Indigenous governance structures with European-style hierarchies that were more amenable to colonial control.</p>

              <p>The Catholic Oblates of Mary Immaculate later continued this work, and it was the Oblate order that would become most closely associated with the residential school system. English Protestant missionaries generally took a different approach, rarely learning Indigenous languages and instead insisting that Indigenous peoples learn English and adopt English cultural practices. Both approaches served the same colonial function: the destruction of Indigenous spiritual life, which was inseparable from Indigenous governance, law, and relationship to the land. Destroying Indigenous spirituality was not a side effect of colonization -- it was a precondition for it.</p>

The schools did not emerge from nowhere; they were the institutional culmination of centuries of strategic evangelization.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>In 1670, King Charles II of England granted a royal charter to the "Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay" -- the Hudson's Bay Company. With a stroke of a pen, the King granted the HBC exclusive trading rights and effective sovereignty over "Rupert's Land": all the territory whose waters drained into Hudson Bay. This encompassed approximately 1.5 million square miles -- roughly 3.9 million square kilometers -- an area larger than most European nations combined. The HBC's actual territorial control would eventually expand to over 8 million square kilometers, encompassing most of what is now western and northern Canada.</p>

              <p>The central absurdity of this grant is rarely stated plainly enough: King Charles II did not own this land. He had never been there. No British person had surveyed, mapped, or established sovereignty over its vast interior. The land was home to dozens of Indigenous nations -- Cree, Ojibwe, Assiniboine, Dene, Inuit, and many others -- who had governed, hunted, fished, and lived on it for thousands of years. The charter simply declared that their sovereignty did not exist, asserting British ownership by royal decree under the same Doctrine of Discovery that had authorized colonial claims worldwide.</p>

              <p>In 1869-1870, the newly formed Dominion of Canada purchased Rupert's Land from the HBC for 300,000 pounds sterling plus one-twentieth of all land in the "fertile belt" (approximately 2.8 million hectares or about 7 million acres). Once again, no Indigenous consent was sought, no Indigenous nation was consulted, and no compensation was offered to the peoples who actually lived on the land. This transaction -- one colonial entity "selling" Indigenous land to another colonial entity -- sparked the Red River Resistance of 1869-1870, led by Louis Riel and the Metis provisional government, who correctly saw it as an illegitimate transfer of their homeland.</p>

            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>The Royal Proclamation of 1763, issued by King George III in the aftermath of the Seven Years' War, stands as one of the most consequential documents in the history of Indigenous-Crown relations. It is often called the "Indian Magna Carta" because it was the first formal recognition by a European power that Indigenous peoples held inherent rights to their lands -- rights that could not simply be seized by settlers or private interests.</p>

              <p>The Proclamation established several foundational principles. First, it acknowledged that Indigenous peoples possessed their traditional territories and were "not to be molested or disturbed" in their use of those lands. Second, it decreed that only the Crown could purchase Indigenous land -- private individuals and colonial governments were prohibited from making direct deals with Indigenous nations. Third, it required that any transfer of Indigenous land must occur through formal, public negotiation. These principles were revolutionary in the context of European colonial law, which had generally treated Indigenous lands as available for the taking.</p>

              <p>The motivations behind the Proclamation were, however, pragmatic rather than altruistic. The British Crown had just fought an expensive war and faced Pontiac's Rebellion -- a powerful Indigenous military resistance across the Great Lakes region. The Proclamation was partly a military strategy to pacify Indigenous nations by recognizing their rights, and partly a mechanism for the Crown to monopolize land acquisition, preventing colonists from independently negotiating with Indigenous nations and creating diplomatic complications. Nevertheless, regardless of its motivations, the Proclamation established legal principles that have endured for over 260 years.</p>

              <p>The Royal Proclamation's significance extends into the present. In 1982, it was embedded into the Canadian Constitution through Section 25 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which protects Aboriginal and treaty rights, including those affirmed by the Proclamation. It serves as the legal foundation for virtually every modern Aboriginal title claim in Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada has repeatedly cited it in landmark decisions affirming Indigenous land rights. In this sense, the Proclamation is not a historical artifact -- it is a living legal instrument whose promises remain largely unfulfilled.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>Canadian Confederation in 1867 is celebrated as the birth of a nation. The British North America Act united the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick into the Dominion of Canada, establishing the federal system of government that persists today. What is rarely emphasized is that this nation was born through the deliberate exclusion of the peoples who had lived on these lands for millennia. Indigenous nations were not invited to the negotiating table, not consulted on the terms, and not given any voice in the creation of the country that would govern their lives.</p>

              <p>The BNA Act was the product of negotiations between English and French colonial elites. These negotiations produced elaborate protections for both founding European groups: guarantees for the French language, Catholic education rights, the preservation of Quebec's civil law system, and protections for Protestant minority rights in Quebec. The English and French negotiated as equals, each securing constitutional protections for their communities' most vital interests -- language, religion, education, and legal systems.</p>

              <p>Indigenous peoples received none of these protections. Instead, the entire relationship between the new federal government and Indigenous nations was reduced to a single phrase in Section 91(24) of the BNA Act, which granted the federal Parliament jurisdiction over "Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians." With those nine words, Indigenous peoples were transformed from sovereign nations into subjects of federal jurisdiction -- wards of the state to be administered, managed, and controlled. Their languages received no protection. Their spiritual practices received no recognition. Their governance systems received no accommodation. Their legal traditions received no standing. They were, in the eyes of Confederation, not peoples with rights but a "problem" to be managed.</p>

              <p>The constitutional structure created by Confederation set the stage for every subsequent injustice: the Indian Act of 1876, the reserve system, the residential schools, the forced relocations, the Sixties Scoop, and the ongoing denial of self-determination. All of these flow from the original decision to exclude Indigenous peoples from the founding of the nation that would exercise power over their lives, lands, and children. Confederation was not merely an act of omission; it was an act of erasure -- a deliberate decision to build a country as if Indigenous peoples did not exist as nations, but only as a category of persons to be governed.</p>

                <p>The concept of "wardship" treated Indigenous peoples as legal minors -- persons incapable of managing their own affairs who required the paternalistic oversight of the federal government. This was not a benevolent arrangement; it was a mechanism of control that stripped Indigenous adults of legal autonomy, prevented them from voting, hiring lawyers, or leaving reserves without permission. The ward system was the legal infrastructure that made residential schools, forced relocations, and cultural suppression possible.</p>

                <p class="topic-subtitle">The myth of mutual agreement and the reality of coerced consent</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>The treaty system is often presented as evidence that Canada's relationship with Indigenous peoples was based on negotiation and mutual consent. The historical record reveals a very different reality. From the earliest Peace and Friendship Treaties in the Maritimes through the Numbered Treaties of the late 19th century, the treaty process was characterized by profound inequalities of power, systematic deception, and a fundamental refusal to engage with Indigenous legal systems on their own terms.</p>

              <p>European treaty commissioners consistently treated Indigenous nations not as sovereign equals but as wards, children, or subordinate subjects. Negotiations were conducted in European languages, written in European legal frameworks, and recorded only in written English or French. Indigenous oral testimony -- the primary legal instrument of Indigenous governance -- was dismissed or ignored. When Indigenous leaders spoke of treaties as sacred agreements between nations, establishing relationships of mutual obligation and shared stewardship of the land, European commissioners recorded only the clauses that served Crown interests: land surrenders, reserve boundaries, and one-time payments.</p>

              <p>The ceremonies that accompanied treaty-making -- the exchange of gifts, the smoking of the pipe, the making of promises -- were understood very differently by each side. Indigenous leaders understood these ceremonies as creating binding, sacred obligations that would last forever. European commissioners understood them as diplomatic formalities that preceded the "real" business of getting signatures on written documents. This was not a misunderstanding between cultures; it was a deliberate exploitation of cultural difference. The Crown's representatives knew that Indigenous peoples placed great weight on oral promises and ceremony, and they used this knowledge to secure agreements that the written documents did not reflect.</p>

              <p>The consequences of this asymmetry persist today. Indigenous nations point to oral promises -- promises of continued hunting and fishing rights, promises of education and healthcare, promises of respect for self-governance -- that were never included in the written texts. Courts have increasingly recognized the validity of these oral terms, but the gap between what was promised and what was delivered remains one of the central injustices of Canadian history. The treaties were not agreements between equals. They were instruments of dispossession dressed in the language of partnership.</p>

                <p>Indigenous legal traditions are oral. Agreements are spoken, witnessed, ceremonially ratified, and transmitted through generations of living memory. European legal traditions privilege the written text as the definitive record. In treaty negotiations, European commissioners used this difference strategically: oral promises were made to secure Indigenous consent, but only the written terms -- which often contradicted or omitted those promises -- were treated as legally binding. Recognizing this dynamic is essential to understanding why Indigenous peoples view most treaties as broken agreements.</p>

                  <p>The Doctrine of Discovery is a legal and religious framework originating from 15th-century Papal Bulls -- Dum Diversas (1452), Romanus Pontifex (1455), and Inter Caetera (1493) -- that declared non-Christian lands could be claimed by European monarchs. It provided the legal justification for colonization, dispossession, and the enslavement of Indigenous peoples. It still matters because it was codified into common law through Johnson v. M'Intosh (1823) and continues to underpin Crown land ownership claims in Canada. The principle that Indigenous peoples hold only "occupancy rights" rather than full sovereignty traces directly to this doctrine.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer" role="region">
                  <p>The Royal Proclamation of 1763 was issued by King George III following the Seven Years' War. It explicitly acknowledged that Indigenous peoples held rights to their lands and established that only the Crown could purchase Indigenous territory -- and only through formal negotiation and treaty. It is called the "Indian Magna Carta" because it represented the first formal recognition by a European power that Indigenous peoples had inherent land rights that could not simply be seized. The Proclamation remains constitutionally significant: it was embedded into Section 25 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982, and it serves as a foundation for modern Aboriginal title claims.</p>

Many children were buried in unmarked graves near the schools because the government would not fund sending their bodies home. Ongoing ground-penetrating radar searches continue to locate previously undocumented burial sites."

Over six years the TRC heard testimony from more than 7,000 survivors, creating a permanent historical record. In 2015 the Commission released its final report with 94 Calls to Action addressing child welfare, education, language preservation, health, and justice. The TRC concluded that the residential school system constituted cultural genocide, and its findings serve as the foundation for ongoing reconciliation efforts in Canada."

              <div class="topic-content">
                <p>Canada's residential school system was not a well-intentioned program that went wrong. It was created intentionally, funded deliberately, and left under-regulated by design. From the outset, these institutions were built on a partnership between the Canadian government and Christian churches &mdash; Catholic, Anglican, United, and Presbyterian &mdash; with a singular purpose: the assimilation of Indigenous peoples into Euro-Canadian society.</p>

                <p>The system was never about education. Provincial schools in the same era were structured around pedagogy, learning outcomes, and child development. Residential schools were structured around separation: separating children from parents, language from identity, culture from memory. They were, in the words of survivors and scholars, <strong>not schools &mdash; but institutions of containment and assimilation.</strong></p>

                <p>The church-state partnership gave the system a veneer of moral authority. The government provided the legal framework and funding; the churches provided the staff and the ideological justification. Together, they built a system that operated for over 160 years across 139 federally recognized institutions, affecting more than 150,000 Indigenous children.</p>

                  <p>When harm occurs in an institution, the critical question is whether the harm resulted from the system failing to work as designed, or from the system working exactly as designed. In the case of residential schools, the evidence is clear: the suffering was not a failure of the system &mdash; it was the system functioning as intended. The goal was the elimination of Indigenous identity, and the methods chosen &mdash; child removal, cultural suppression, and forced assimilation &mdash; were the direct means to achieve that goal.</p>

                </div>

              <div class="topic-content">
                <p>The Canadian government's own records reveal how it understood the so-called "Indian problem." Indigenous peoples were seen as "getting in the way" &mdash; of railway construction, of western settlement, of resource extraction, and of the consolidation of federal power over the land. They were resisting, as any peoples would, the theft of their territories and the erasure of their sovereignty.</p>

                <p>The options considered were brutally direct:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Extermination</strong> &mdash; physical destruction of Indigenous populations</li>
                  <li><strong>Containment</strong> &mdash; confinement to reserves, controlled movement</li>
                  <li><strong>Enslavement</strong> &mdash; forced labor under colonial authority</li>
                  <li><strong>Assimilation</strong> &mdash; cultural destruction through institutional replacement of identity</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Residential schools were chosen as the "humane" option. The strategy was precise: break the bond between parent and child, destroy language, culture, and identity, and replace them with Christianity, obedience, and menial labour skills. As Duncan Campbell Scott, the long-serving Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs, made explicitly clear, the goal was the disappearance of Indigenous peoples as distinct nations.</p>

                  <p class="primary-source__label">Primary Source</p>

                  <p class="primary-source__text">"I want to get rid of the Indian problem. I do not think as a matter of fact, that the country ought to continuously protect a class of people who are able to stand alone...

                </div>

                <p>This was not a low-ranking official speaking carelessly. Duncan Campbell Scott was the architect of federal Indian policy for decades. His words reveal the eliminatory logic at the heart of the residential school system: the "Indian problem" would be solved when there were no more Indians.</p>

                  <p>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission concluded that Canada's residential school system constituted <strong>cultural genocide</strong> &mdash; the deliberate destruction of a people's culture, language, spiritual practices, and family structures, even when individual physical survival was permitted. Cultural genocide targets the existence of a group as a group. By removing children, outlawing ceremony, and criminalizing language, the Canadian government sought to destroy Indigenous nations from the inside out.</p>

                <p>Attendance at residential schools was made mandatory for Indigenous children between the ages of four and sixteen. This was not a suggestion, an invitation, or a choice &mdash; it was enforced by law. RCMP officers and Indian agents were dispatched to communities to collect children, often without warning. Parents who resisted could be fined or jailed.</p>

                <p>Children who ran away were forcibly returned. The system treated escape as defiance, not as a child's natural response to fear, abuse, and isolation. Some children ran hundreds of kilometres through wilderness to reach home, only to be collected again. Others died trying &mdash; from exposure, drowning, or exhaustion &mdash; their deaths recorded as accidents rather than consequences of a system that held children captive.</p>

                <p>The severing of the parent-child bond was not a side effect of the system. It was the primary mechanism. Government officials and church administrators understood that cultural knowledge is transmitted generationally &mdash; through family, through language, through daily life. By removing children at the youngest possible age and keeping them away for years at a time, the system ensured that the chain of cultural transmission would be broken.</p>

                <p>Parents lost all control. They could not determine where their children went, what was taught, what language was spoken, what religion was practiced, or whether their children were safe, fed, or alive. This state-sanctioned child removal continued for over a century, from the 1880s until the last federally operated residential school closed in 1996.</p>

                  <p>The forcible removal of children from their families created cascading intergenerational trauma. Parents who had their children taken experienced grief, helplessness, and rage. Children who were taken experienced abandonment, confusion, and abuse. When those children became parents, many had never experienced healthy family relationships. The effects of this severing &mdash; addiction, mental illness, family breakdown &mdash; are not individual failings. They are the predictable outcomes of a system designed to destroy families.</p>

                <p>If the residential school system had been genuinely designed to educate Indigenous children, the funding would have reflected that purpose. It did not. In the 1930s, residential schools received approximately <strong>$180 per child per year</strong>. Comparable institutions for non-Indigenous children received three times that amount. The gap was not an accident &mdash; it was policy.</p>

                <p>The per-capita funding model created a perverse incentive structure: schools received money based on the number of children enrolled. More children meant more money. This led to the admission of children who were already sick &mdash; particularly with tuberculosis &mdash; spreading disease through cramped, poorly ventilated dormitories. Schools had a financial incentive to keep enrollment high, regardless of the health consequences.</p>

                <p>The underfunding affected every dimension of children's lives:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Food:</strong> Children were chronically malnourished. Some schools used students as subjects in nutritional experiments, deliberately withholding adequate food to study the effects of malnutrition.</li>
                  <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Medical care was minimal or absent. Sick children were not separated from healthy ones. Treatment was often delayed until it was too late.</li>
                  <li><strong>Education:</strong> Half the day was spent in manual labour &mdash; farming, laundry, cleaning &mdash; not learning. Academic instruction was basic and rudimentary.</li>
                  <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Buildings were poorly constructed, badly maintained, and often fire hazards. Ventilation was inadequate, contributing directly to the spread of tuberculosis.</li>

                  <p>Budgets reveal priorities. When a government says it values something but refuses to fund it adequately, the budget tells the truth. The persistent, decades-long underfunding of residential schools was not a bureaucratic oversight. It was a deliberate choice that reveals the system's true purpose: containment and assimilation, not education. If the goal had been education, funding would have matched provincial standards. It never did.</p>

                <p>The regulatory framework governing residential schools reveals another dimension of deliberate neglect. Provincial schools operated under approximately <strong>90 pages of regulations</strong> covering curriculum standards, teacher qualifications, student-teacher ratios, building codes, ventilation requirements, food quality, health protocols, and discipline policies. Residential schools operated under roughly <strong>4 pages</strong>.</p>

                <p>This was not because residential schools were simpler institutions. They were 24-hour, 365-day custodial environments housing thousands of children far from their families. They required more regulation, not less. The near-total absence of standards was a conscious decision that created the conditions in which abuse could flourish unchecked.</p>

                <p>With no enforceable standards, there were:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>No food standards</strong> &mdash; children could be starved without consequence</li>
                  <li><strong>No health protocols</strong> &mdash; disease could spread unaddressed</li>
                  <li><strong>No teacher qualification requirements</strong> &mdash; untrained individuals held authority over children</li>
                  <li><strong>No discipline guidelines</strong> &mdash; physical punishment had no limits</li>
                  <li><strong>No building safety codes</strong> &mdash; structures were fire hazards with locked dormitories</li>
                  <li><strong>No ventilation requirements</strong> &mdash; overcrowded sleeping quarters accelerated tuberculosis transmission</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The lack of regulation was the regulation. The government's choice to leave residential schools functionally unregulated was itself a policy decision &mdash; one that guaranteed harm while providing the government with plausible deniability. Officials could claim ignorance of conditions they had deliberately chosen not to monitor.</p>

                  <p>Consider the regulatory disparity: ~90 pages governing provincial schools where children went home each evening, versus ~4 pages governing residential schools where children were held for months or years at a time, far from any family or community oversight. The institutions that required the most protection for children received the least. This inversion was not accidental &mdash; it was structural.</p>

                <p>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission heard testimony from more than 7,000 survivors. Their accounts reveal a consistent pattern across different schools, different churches, different decades, and different regions of the country. The abuse was not the work of a few bad individuals in an otherwise sound system. It was routine, widespread, and institutional.</p>

                <p><strong>Physical abuse</strong> was the daily reality. Children were beaten for speaking their languages, for crying, for wetting the bed, for being slow, for being defiant, for being children. Punishments included strapping, caning, forced standing for hours, confinement in closets or basements, and public humiliation.</p>

                <p><strong>Sexual abuse</strong> was widespread. Both male and female children were targeted by staff &mdash; clergy, teachers, administrators, and older students who had themselves been abused. The isolation of the schools, the absence of oversight, and the authority of the perpetrators created an environment where predators operated with impunity for decades.</p>

                <p><strong>Emotional degradation</strong> was constant. Children's names were taken and replaced with numbers or English names. Speaking Indigenous languages was punished &mdash; mouths washed with soap, needles pushed through tongues. Spiritual practices were forbidden and replaced with mandatory Christian worship. Children were told their families were savage, their cultures worthless, and their identities shameful.</p>

                  <p>The replacement of Indigenous names with numbers or English names was not administrative convenience. It was identity erasure &mdash; a deliberate act of dehumanization. A name carries lineage, clan, territory, language, and belonging. Removing it strips a child of their place in the world. This practice, combined with language suppression and religious coercion, constituted a systematic assault on the child's sense of self &mdash; a form of psychological violence whose effects lasted lifetimes.</p>

              <div class="topic-content">
                <p>Among the most disturbing dimensions of residential school abuse was its ritualization. In some institutions, sexual abuse was not merely opportunistic &mdash; it was systematized and given a veneer of religious legitimacy. Abuse was framed as "cleansing," intertwined with the sacrament of confession. Children were made to confess to imagined sins, and sexual acts were imposed as supposed acts of purification or penance.</p>

                <p>This intertwining of abuse with religious ritual accomplished several things simultaneously. It gave the abuser authority and justification. It confused the child about the nature of what was happening. It created shame so deep that disclosure felt impossible &mdash; because the abuse had been framed as sacred, speaking about it felt like blasphemy.</p>

                <p>Children knew. The abuse was so prevalent that it was known among the students, who named it in their own Ojibwe language. They had words for what was happening to them &mdash; words their abusers could not understand. This linguistic survival was itself an act of resistance, a way of maintaining clarity about reality in an environment designed to distort it.</p>

                <blockquote>
                  <p>Normalize it. Ritualize it. Silence it.</p>
                  <cite>&mdash; From Episode 3: Residential Schools</cite>
                </blockquote>

                <p>This three-part formula describes how institutional abuse perpetuates itself. By normalizing the abuse as part of daily life, ritualizing it through religious practice, and silencing it through shame and fear, the system ensured that children could not name what was happening as wrong, could not report it, and could not escape it. The formula worked for decades.</p>

                  <p>The silence of survivors was not consent, complicity, or acceptance. It was the product of a carefully constructed system of control. Children were taught that the abuse was their fault, that God sanctioned it, and that speaking about it would bring further punishment. Many survivors carried this silence for decades before finding the courage &mdash; and an audience willing to listen &mdash; to speak. The TRC provided that audience for over 7,000 survivors.</p>

                  <p class="primary-source__text">In 1907, Dr. Peter Bryce, the Chief Medical Officer of Indian Affairs, conducted inspections of residential schools across western Canada. His findings were devastating: the overall mortality rate among children who had attended residential schools was 25 percent. At some individual schools, the death rate reached as high as 69 percent. The primary cause was tuberculosis, spread by overcrowding, poor ventilation, and the deliberate admission of sick children alongside healthy ones.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Dr. Bryce submitted his report to the government and recommended immediate reforms: improved ventilation, separation of sick and healthy children, better nutrition, and proper medical care. His report was not classified or lost &mdash; it was deliberately buried. Bryce was marginalized within the government and eventually forced out of his position. He later published his findings independently in a pamphlet titled <em>"The Story of a National Crime"</em> in 1922.</p>

                <p>The government's response to Bryce's findings was not reform but suppression. The system continued unchanged. Children continued to die. The per-capita funding model continued to incentivize the admission of sick children. And the government continued to avoid accountability for the deaths occurring in its institutions.</p>

                <p>When ground-penetrating radar confirmed the presence of 215 unmarked burials at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School in May 2021, many Canadians expressed shock. But the deaths at Kamloops and at other schools were not new revelations &mdash; they were confirmations of what survivors, families, and researchers had been saying for decades.</p>

                <p>When children died at residential schools, the government rarely funded the return of their bodies to their home communities. Shipping a child's remains across hundreds of kilometres was an expense the government was unwilling to bear. Instead, children were buried on or near school grounds, often without headstones, markers, or formal records. Families were sometimes not even notified of their child's death.</p>

                <p>The TRC documented this pattern across the country. More than 2,000 named deaths were recorded, along with more than 1,000 unnamed deaths. But the Commission was clear: thousands more children remain unaccounted for. School records were incomplete, deliberately destroyed, or never created. Some children simply disappeared from the record &mdash; present one year, absent the next, with no documentation of what happened to them.</p>

                <p>The use of ground-penetrating radar at former school sites beginning in 2021 is not speculation. It is evidence gathering &mdash; a forensic technique used in investigations worldwide. The technology detects soil disturbances consistent with human burials. It does not "discover" graves in the sense of making claims without evidence. It confirms what survivors and families have always known: children were buried at these schools, and the burials were never properly documented or memorialized.</p>

                  <p>As of the mid-2020s, investigations using ground-penetrating radar continue at dozens of former residential school sites across Canada. Each investigation is conducted under the direction of the Indigenous community associated with that school. These are not abstract archaeological projects &mdash; they are acts of bringing children home. Every anomaly detected represents a potential child whose family never knew where they were buried, whose death may never have been officially recorded, and whose name may have been lost.</p>

                <p>The absence of markers was itself a message. It told families their children were not worth memorializing. It told communities their grief was not worth acknowledging. And it told history that these deaths did not matter enough to record. The ongoing search for unmarked graves is, at its core, a refusal to accept that message &mdash; an insistence that every child mattered, that every death must be accounted for, and that the truth will eventually be known.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>It protects the national self-image.</strong> Canada's identity as a peaceful, tolerant, multicultural nation cannot easily accommodate the reality of cultural genocide directed at children. Denial allows Canadians to maintain a version of their country's history that is incomplete but comfortable.</li>
                  <li><strong>It avoids moral responsibility.</strong> Acknowledging the residential school system as what it was &mdash; a system of cultural genocide &mdash; carries implications. It implies obligation: to survivors, to communities, to the project of reconciliation. Denial allows the avoidance of that obligation.</li>
                  <li><strong>It preserves privilege.</strong> The land, resources, and institutions that Canadians benefit from today were built on the dispossession of Indigenous peoples. The residential school system was one mechanism of that dispossession. Denial allows the ongoing enjoyment of those benefits without confronting their origin.</li>
                </ul>

                <blockquote>
                  <p>"Never again" means nothing without acceptance of what happened in the first place.</p>

                  <p>Denial operates on multiple levels. <strong>Literal denial</strong> claims the events did not happen. <strong>Interpretive denial</strong> admits the facts but reframes their meaning &mdash; "it was a different time," "there were good intentions." <strong>Implicatory denial</strong> accepts the facts and their meaning but denies their relevance to the present &mdash; "that was then, this is now." All three forms share a common function: they interrupt the connection between historical truth and present responsibility.</p>

              <div class="topic-content">
                <p>The path to accountability began with survivors breaking decades of silence. In 1990, Phil Fontaine, then Grand Chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, became one of the first prominent Indigenous leaders to publicly disclose the sexual abuse he experienced at residential school. His testimony on national television shattered the pretense that the schools had been benign institutions and opened the door for thousands of other survivors to share their stories.</p>

                <p>What followed was the largest class-action settlement in Canadian history. Thousands of individual lawsuits, along with collective legal action, led to the <strong>Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA)</strong> in 2007. The settlement included financial compensation for survivors, a fund for healing programs, and the establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</p>

                <p>Kathleen Makepeace-Fiddler played a pivotal role in architecting a justice process that centered survivors rather than institutions. The approach was built on three pillars:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Truth-telling:</strong> Creating safe spaces for survivors to share their experiences on their own terms</li>
                  <li><strong>Healing:</strong> Recognizing that justice for residential school survivors required more than financial compensation &mdash; it required acknowledgment, validation, and support for healing</li>
                  <li><strong>Dignity:</strong> Ensuring that the process respected survivors as whole people, not just claimants in a legal proceeding</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission operated from 2008 to 2015, hearing testimony from more than 7,000 survivors across the country. Its work produced a comprehensive historical record, a final report, and 94 Calls to Action addressing child welfare, education, language and culture, health, and justice. The TRC's conclusion was unequivocal: the residential school system constituted cultural genocide.</p>

                  <p>The TRC's 94 Calls to Action are not suggestions. They are a comprehensive framework for addressing the legacy of residential schools and advancing reconciliation. They cover child welfare reform, education curriculum changes, language preservation, missing children and burial sites, health equity, and the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. As of the mid-2020s, progress on implementing the Calls to Action has been uneven, with many remaining unfulfilled.</p>

              <div class="topic-content">
                <p>The path to apology was long and uneven. The Oblates of Mary Immaculate were among the first to apologize in 1991, acknowledging their role in the residential school system. Other religious orders and denominations followed at various points, though the depth and sincerity of these apologies varied widely.</p>

                <p>The Catholic Church, which operated the largest number of residential schools, was among the last institutions to offer a formal apology. For decades, the Vatican resisted calls for a papal statement. It was not until 2022, following the discoveries at Kamloops and other sites, that a delegation of Indigenous leaders &mdash; First Nations, Inuit, and Metis &mdash; travelled to the Vatican. Pope Francis met with survivors and spoke the words many had waited a lifetime to hear:</p>

                <blockquote>
                  <p>"I am sorry. I believe you."</p>
                  <cite>&mdash; Pope Francis, Vatican Delegation Meeting, 2022</cite>
                </blockquote>

                <p>These five words carried enormous weight. For survivors who had been told for decades that they were lying, that they were exaggerating, that what happened to them was not that bad, or that they should simply forgive and move on &mdash; being believed was itself an act of justice. The apology did not erase the harm. It could not undo what had been done. But it lifted a burden that many survivors had carried for their entire lives: the burden of not being believed.</p>

                <p>In 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper delivered a formal apology on behalf of the Government of Canada in the House of Commons. The apology acknowledged the policy of assimilation, recognized the harm caused to children and families, and stated that "the Government of Canada sincerely apologizes and asks the forgiveness of the Aboriginal peoples of this country for failing them so profoundly."</p>

                  <h3 class="key-concept__title">The Function of Apology</h3>
                  <p>A genuine apology accomplishes several things. It <strong>validates</strong> the experience of those who were harmed. It <strong>acknowledges</strong> that the harm was wrong. It <strong>assigns responsibility</strong> to the party that caused the harm. And it <strong>creates a public record</strong> that cannot be undone. An apology does not fix what was broken. But without it, the silence of the institution becomes an ongoing endorsement of what occurred. Apology breaks that silence and shifts the moral weight from the survivor &mdash; who is no longer required to prove their suffering &mdash; to the institution that caused it.</p>

                <p>The history of residential schools is not a call to hate Canada. It is a call to tell the truth about Canada &mdash; so that what happened can never happen again. The two are not the same. Hatred looks away from complexity. Truth demands engagement with it.</p>

                <blockquote>
                  <p>You cannot love this country honestly without holding its contradictions.</p>
                  <cite>&mdash; From Episode 3: Residential Schools</cite>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Canada is a country built on Indigenous land, with Indigenous peoples, through agreements that were violated, policies that were genocidal, and institutions that caused immeasurable harm. Canada is also a country where survivors fought for truth, where a national commission documented the record, where apologies were given and received, and where the work of reconciliation &mdash; incomplete and imperfect &mdash; continues.</p>

                <p>Both of these things are true simultaneously. The mature response is not to choose one and deny the other. It is to hold both and to ask: what does this require of us? What obligations arise from this history? What must change so that the promise of "never again" is not empty?</p>

                <p>The residential school system was not ancient history. The last school closed in 1996. Survivors are alive today. Their children and grandchildren carry the effects of what was done. The intergenerational impacts &mdash; in health, in family structures, in educational outcomes, in incarceration rates, in child welfare involvement &mdash; are measurable, documented, and ongoing.</p>

                <p>To know this history is the minimum requirement. To act on it is the real work.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                  <p>Canada's residential schools were government-funded, church-run institutions that operated from the 1830s to 1996. They were created as a deliberate policy of assimilation, designed to separate Indigenous children from their families, destroy their languages, cultures, and identities, and replace them with Euro-Canadian Christian values. Over 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and Metis children were forced to attend 139 federally recognized schools. The system was built on a partnership between the Canadian government, which provided funding and legal enforcement, and Christian churches &mdash; Catholic, Anglican, United, and Presbyterian &mdash; which operated the schools. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission concluded that these schools were part of a policy of cultural genocide.</p>

                  <p>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission documented over 3,200 confirmed deaths of children in residential schools, though the actual number is believed to be significantly higher due to incomplete and destroyed records. As early as 1907, Dr. Peter Bryce reported mortality rates of 25% overall and up to 69% at some schools, primarily from tuberculosis exacerbated by overcrowding, malnutrition, and poor ventilation. Many children were buried in unmarked graves near the schools because the government would not fund the return of their remains to their families. Since 2021, ground-penetrating radar searches at former school sites have confirmed the presence of hundreds of previously undocumented burial sites across Canada.</p>

In 2015, the Commission released its final report containing 94 Calls to Action addressing child welfare, education, language preservation, health, justice, and the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The TRC concluded that the residential school system constituted cultural genocide.

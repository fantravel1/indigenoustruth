Indian Act governance was imposed by Canada in 1876 and operates through elected band councils on reserves under federal law, with two- or three-year election cycles and authority limited to what the Indian Act permits. Hereditary or traditional governance predates colonization and is rooted in Indigenous law, kinship systems, and territorial responsibility — it is often matriarchal, with leadership passed through clans and validated by ceremony and community consensus. Conflict arises when Canada recognizes only the Indian Act system and disregards hereditary authority, as was starkly demonstrated during the Wet'suwet'en pipeline crisis of 2020, when elected band councils consented to a pipeline but hereditary chiefs — the traditional authority over unceded territory — refused."

As residential schools began to close, child removal continued the same policy of cultural erasure through a different mechanism — children were placed in foster care or adopted into non-Indigenous families across Canada, the United States, and overseas. Tens of thousands of children were affected. Many had their names, birth dates, and identities altered to prevent reunification with their families. The Sixties Scoop caused profound intergenerational trauma including loss of language, cultural identity, family connection, and belonging, with effects that continue to reverberate through Indigenous communities today."

It does not mean secession from Canada. Indigenous sovereignty movements seek self-rule within Canada: the recognition of Indigenous legal orders, respect for treaty relationships, fair resource sharing, and the dignity of being treated as founding peoples rather than subjects of colonial administration. As expressed by Indigenous leaders: 'We love this country too. We just want to be respected within it.' This understanding of sovereignty is consistent with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), which Canada endorsed in 2016 and legislated through the UNDRIP Act in 2021."

              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>As residential schools began to decline in the mid-twentieth century, the mechanism of cultural erasure did not end -- it simply changed form. Provincial child welfare agencies stepped in where the federal government and churches had operated for decades, removing Indigenous children en masse from their families and communities. This process, which became known as the <strong>Sixties Scoop</strong>, represents one of the most devastating continuations of colonial policy in Canadian history.</p>

              <p>Though the term references the 1960s, the practice began as early as the 1950s and continued well into the 1980s. Tens of thousands of Indigenous children were taken from their homes. Many were adopted into non-Indigenous families across Canada, the United States, and even overseas. The geographic and cultural distances were deliberate: children were placed so far from their communities that reunification became nearly impossible.</p>

              <p>In many cases, children's <strong>names were changed, their birth dates altered, and their identities rewritten</strong> to sever ties with their families permanently. Where residential schools had institutionalized children collectively, the Sixties Scoop atomized them -- scattering them across the continent as isolated individuals stripped of language, culture, and kin.</p>

              <div class="key-concept">
                <p class="key-concept__label">Key Concept</p>
                <h3 class="key-concept__title">Continuity of Policy, Change of Method</h3>
                <p>The Sixties Scoop was not a new policy -- it was the same objective pursued through different means. Residential schools removed children to institutions; the Sixties Scoop removed children to individual non-Indigenous households. Both aimed to sever the transmission of Indigenous language, culture, and identity from one generation to the next. The policy of child removal remained constant; only the administrative mechanism changed.</p>

              <p>The Sixties Scoop class-action settlement of 2017 acknowledged the harm but could never restore what was taken: years of childhood, family bonds, language, ceremonies, and the fundamental sense of belonging that defines identity. For many survivors, the search for their birth families, their original names, and their communities continues to this day.</p>

                <p class="topic-subtitle">Trauma, Loss, and the Path to Reclamation</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>The consequences of the Sixties Scoop extend far beyond the generation that was directly affected. Like residential schools before it, the forced removal of children created cycles of intergenerational trauma that continue to shape Indigenous communities today. The loss of language, family connection, and cultural identity fragmented entire kinship networks -- and that fragmentation was by design.</p>

              <p>Children who were removed often grew up carrying deep shame that had been <strong>engineered into their appearance, their names, and their bodies</strong>. Many were told their families had abandoned them, that their cultures were inferior, that their brown skin was something to overcome. When these children grew into adults, many found themselves repeating cycles of foster care -- not because they were unfit parents, but because they had never been given the tools of parenting that generations of cultural knowledge would have provided.</p>

              <div class="pull-quote">
                <p class="pull-quote__text">We are royalty on this land. Our children were stolen, our names were changed, our languages were silenced. But we are still here. And we are reclaiming everything they tried to take.</p>
                <p class="pull-quote__attribution">-- Indigenous community leader, from Episode 4</p>
              </div>

              <p>Yet the story of intergenerational impact is not only one of loss. Across the country, a powerful counter-movement has emerged: Indigenous peoples <strong>reclaiming their names</strong>, reviving their languages, rebuilding family connections, and teaching their children that their identity is not something to hide but something to celebrate. This healing is not clinical -- it is <strong>cultural, linguistic, and embodied</strong>. It happens in ceremony, in language nests, in land-based education, in the simple act of an Elder speaking their language to a grandchild.</p>

              <div class="key-concept">
                <p class="key-concept__label">Key Concept</p>
                <h3 class="key-concept__title">Healing as Cultural Practice</h3>
                <p>Western models of trauma recovery focus on individual therapy and clinical intervention. For many Indigenous communities, healing is inseparable from cultural reclamation. Learning one's language, participating in ceremony, reconnecting with land and kinship -- these are not supplements to healing; they are healing itself. The revitalization of culture is simultaneously the repair of what colonialism broke.</p>
              </div>

              <p>The intergenerational cost of child removal has been documented by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, and countless community-level studies. But the full weight of that cost is carried not in reports but in the lived experiences of families still working to reconnect across the distances that colonial policy created.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>The Sixties Scoop and the broader experience of colonial child removal did more than traumatize families -- it politicized them. The mass removal of children accelerated a growing <strong>political consciousness</strong> among Indigenous peoples across Canada. If the state could take your children, alter their identities, and send them across an ocean with no recourse, then the question of political power was not abstract. It was intimate. It was urgent.</p>

              <p>Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Indigenous leaders began organizing at the national level with unprecedented urgency. But the federal government did not welcome this development. Ottawa actively worked to <strong>block national Indigenous organizing</strong>. Leaders were surveilled by the RCMP. Funding was manipulated to create divisions between communities.

                <p class="primary-source__text">The National Indian Brotherhood (NIB) was formed in 1968 as the first pan-Canadian political body representing First Nations. In 1982, it was reorganized as the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), a body representing First Nations chiefs from across Canada. Separately, the Inuit and M&eacute;tis peoples developed their own national representative bodies -- Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK) and the M&eacute;tis National Council (MNC) -- reflecting the distinct political, legal, and cultural realities of each group.</p>
              </div>

              <p>The creation of national Indigenous political organizations was not simply an act of institution-building. It was an act of resistance. In a country that had spent a century trying to eliminate Indigenous identity, the formation of bodies like the NIB and AFN declared that Indigenous peoples were not a "problem" to be administered, but <strong>nations with political rights, legal standing, and the capacity for self-governance</strong>.</p>

                <p>The AFN represents First Nations peoples. The M&eacute;tis National Council represents the M&eacute;tis Nation. Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami represents Inuit.

Understanding Indigenous politics in Canada requires understanding that "Indigenous" is not a monolith but an umbrella term encompassing diverse nations with diverse political structures.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>To understand the conflicts that define Indigenous politics in Canada, you must understand that <strong>two fundamentally different governance systems coexist</strong> within many Indigenous communities -- and they often contradict each other.</p>

              <p>The first is <strong>Indian Act governance</strong>, imposed by Canada through the Indian Act of 1876 and its subsequent amendments. This system operates through elected band councils on reserves. Chiefs and councillors serve two- or three-year terms. Their authority is defined and limited by federal law. They manage reserve lands, administer programs, and act as the interface between their communities and the Canadian government. This system was designed by and for the colonial state.</p>

              <p>The second is <strong>hereditary or traditional governance</strong>, which predates European contact by millennia. These systems are rooted in Indigenous law, kinship structures, and territorial responsibility. Leadership is often matriarchal, with authority passing through clan mothers or hereditary lines validated by ceremony and community consensus. Traditional governance is not limited to reserves -- it extends across entire traditional territories, which often encompass vast unceded lands.</p>

              <div class="info-card info-card--warning">
                <p class="info-card__label info-card__label--warning">Critical Distinction</p>
                <p>These are not two versions of the same thing. Indian Act governance is a colonial construct imposed from outside. Hereditary governance is Indigenous law that has operated for thousands of years. When Canada recognizes only the Indian Act system and ignores Indigenous legal orders, it is not making a neutral administrative choice -- it is choosing colonial authority over Indigenous authority. This distinction is at the heart of nearly every major conflict between Indigenous peoples and the Canadian state.</p>

For over a century, it has been the primary legislative tool through which Canada has administered -- and controlled -- First Nations peoples. Its governance provisions were designed to replace, not complement, Indigenous political systems.</p>

              <p>In 2020, the conflict over the Coastal GasLink pipeline through Wet'suwet'en traditional territory in British Columbia became a national crisis that laid bare the fundamental contradiction in Canada's approach to Indigenous governance. The facts are stark: a major pipeline was proposed to cross 190 kilometres of Wet'suwet'en territory. The elected band councils -- created under the Indian Act -- signed benefit agreements and consented to the project. But the <strong>hereditary chiefs</strong>, whose authority over the territory has been recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada, refused.</p>

              <p>Canada chose to recognize only the elected councils. Courts issued injunctions. The RCMP moved in with tactical units, militarized checkpoints, and weapons drawn. Journalists were arrested. Land defenders were removed from their own territories. Solidarity blockades erupted across the country, shutting down rail lines and ports.</p>

              <div class="pull-quote">
                <p class="pull-quote__text">Consent was sought from the wrong authority. The band councils have jurisdiction over reserve lands -- a fraction of Wet'suwet'en territory.

                <p class="legal-precedent__citation">Supreme Court of Canada, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1010</p>
                <p>In 1997, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in <em>Delgamuukw v. British Columbia</em> that the Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan peoples hold Aboriginal title to their traditional territories. The court recognized Wet'suwet'en oral histories as legitimate evidence and affirmed that Aboriginal title includes the right to exclusive use and occupation of the land. Despite this ruling, the Crown continued to authorize industrial projects on Wet'suwet'en territory without the consent of hereditary chiefs -- the very authorities the court had recognized.</p>
              </div>

              <p>The Wet'suwet'en crisis was not a local dispute about a pipeline. It was a constitutional crisis about the nature of sovereignty in Canada. It violated the principles of the <strong>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)</strong>, which Canada had endorsed in 2016 and which requires free, prior, and informed consent. It contradicted the spirit of reconciliation. And it demonstrated, with painful clarity, that when Indigenous rights conflict with economic interests, Canada consistently chooses economics.</p>

The Wet'suwet'en crisis demonstrated that Canada had failed to meet this standard -- seeking consent from Indian Act band councils rather than from the hereditary authorities who hold jurisdiction over the territory under Indigenous law.</p>

              <p>The Wet'suwet'en crisis was dramatic, but it was not unique. The same fundamental conflict -- between Indigenous sovereignty and Canadian state authority -- has erupted in communities across the country, decade after decade, with a consistency that reveals not a series of isolated incidents but a <strong>systemic pattern</strong>.</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Six Nations / Haudenosaunee Confederacy:</strong> The Six Nations of the Grand River have one of the oldest continuous democratic governance systems in the world -- the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. Canada imposed an elected band council system in 1924 by force, using RCMP officers to remove the hereditary council. The legitimacy dispute continues to this day.</li>
                <li><strong>Oka / Kanesatake (1990):</strong> The town of Oka, Quebec, attempted to expand a golf course onto Mohawk burial grounds and sacred pine groves. When Mohawk land defenders established a barricade, the Suret&eacute; du Qu&eacute;bec launched a raid, during which Corporal Marcel Lemay was killed. The Canadian Army was deployed. The 78-day standoff became an international symbol of Indigenous resistance.</li>
                <li><strong>Caledonia (2006):</strong> Six Nations land defenders occupied a housing development on disputed land near Caledonia, Ontario. The occupation lasted over a year and exposed deep tensions between Indigenous territorial claims and provincial development interests.</li>
                <li><strong>Ipperwash (1995):</strong> Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation occupied Ipperwash Provincial Park, built on land expropriated by the federal government during World War II. Ontario Provincial Police shot and killed unarmed protester <strong>Dudley George</strong> -- the first Indigenous person killed in a land rights dispute in Canada since the nineteenth century.</li>
                <li><strong>Idle No More (2012):</strong> A grassroots movement that began in Saskatchewan and spread across the country in response to federal omnibus legislation that weakened environmental protections for waterways and reduced Indigenous consultation requirements. Idle No More demonstrated the power of Indigenous-led social movements in the digital age.</li>

                <p>Every one of these conflicts shares the same root cause: <strong>sovereignty</strong>. Not secession. Not chaos. Self-rule within Canada. The right of Indigenous peoples to govern their own territories according to their own laws, with their own consent. The fact that this principle continues to produce crisis after crisis is not evidence of Indigenous unreasonableness -- it is evidence of Canada's refusal to meaningfully share power.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>Canada's legal system has, over decades, produced a body of case law that appears to recognize Indigenous rights -- but that recognition consistently stops short of transferring real power. The gap between what courts say and what governments do has become one of the defining features of Indigenous-Crown relations.</p>

              <div class="legal-precedent">
                <p class="legal-precedent__label">Constitutional Framework</p>

                <p class="legal-precedent__citation">Part II of the Constitution Act, 1982</p>
                <p>Section 35(1) states: "The existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed." This provision was a landmark achievement -- for the first time, Aboriginal rights were constitutionally protected. But Section 35 does not define what those rights are. It does not enumerate them, does not specify their scope, and does not establish mechanisms for their enforcement. The result: decades of litigation in which Indigenous peoples must prove, case by case, that their rights exist.</p>
              </div>

              <p>Courts have moved incrementally. Fishing rights have been recognized -- but limited to a "moderate livelihood," a vague standard that invites conflict. Aboriginal title has been affirmed -- but the Crown retains what it calls "underlying title," meaning that even when Indigenous peoples prove their territorial rights, the state claims a superior interest.</p>

                <p>The 1973 <em>Calder</em> decision was the first time the Supreme Court of Canada acknowledged that Aboriginal title existed in Canadian law as a legal right derived from Indigenous peoples' historic occupation of their lands -- not from any grant by the Crown. Though the Nisga'a lost on a procedural technicality (3-3 with one judge dismissing on procedure), the case fundamentally changed Canadian law and led directly to the creation of the federal comprehensive land claims process.</p>
              </div>

              <p>The pattern is clear: Indigenous peoples win legal recognition of their rights, but governments resist implementation. Court victories become the beginning of decades-long negotiations rather than the end of injustice. Legal wins accumulate without translating into real control over lands, resources, or governance. The courts recognize; the Crown delays. The law affirms; the government obstructs.</p>

                <p>Legal scholars and Indigenous leaders have identified a persistent "implementation gap" -- the distance between court decisions that affirm Indigenous rights and the on-the-ground reality of those rights being exercised. Court victories are necessary but not sufficient. Without political will, legal recognition becomes a form of symbolic justice that changes language without changing power.</p>

            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>In June 1990, one of the most powerful acts of political resistance in Canadian history took the form of a single word, spoken softly, eight times.</p>

              <p>The <strong>Meech Lake Accord</strong> was a constitutional amendment package designed to bring Quebec into the constitutional framework by recognizing it as a "distinct society" within Canada. It had been negotiated behind closed doors by the Prime Minister and ten provincial premiers. No Indigenous leaders were at the table. No Indigenous rights were addressed. Once again, the founding peoples of this land were excluded from the conversation about its constitutional future.</p>

              <p><strong>Elijah Harper</strong>, a Cree member of the Manitoba Legislative Assembly, recognized the injustice. Under Manitoba's procedural rules, the Accord required unanimous consent to proceed to a vote before the federal deadline. Harper, holding an eagle feather -- a symbol of truth and courage in Cree tradition -- simply said <strong>"No."</strong></p>

              <div class="pull-quote">

              </div>

              <p>Harper refused to grant the procedural consent needed for the Accord to proceed. He said "No" on eight consecutive occasions over several days. The Meech Lake Accord collapsed. Its failure triggered a national reckoning about who belongs at the constitutional table, and whether Canada's founding narrative could continue to exclude Indigenous peoples.</p>

              </div>

              <p>Harper's act demonstrated something profound: that Indigenous consent is not optional in Canadian democracy. That constitutional change cannot proceed by excluding the peoples who were here first. His eagle feather became a symbol recognized across the country -- a reminder that resistance does not require armies, only courage and principle.</p>

              <p>The collapse of the Meech Lake Accord did not solve the problem of Indigenous exclusion from constitutional politics -- but it permanently altered the equation. After 1990, it became politically impossible to negotiate constitutional change in Canada without Indigenous participation. Elijah Harper had established a precedent that no future government could ignore.</p>

              <p>In the aftermath, <strong>Indigenous leaders were invited to federal-provincial meetings</strong> for the first time as participants rather than observers. The Charlottetown Accord of 1992 -- the next attempt at constitutional reform -- included provisions for Indigenous self-government and was negotiated with Indigenous leaders at the table. Representatives of First Nations, Inuit, and M&eacute;tis peoples participated directly in the constitutional discussions.</p>

                <p>The post-Meech Lake era did not deliver full self-government. The Charlottetown Accord was ultimately defeated in a national referendum. But the shift in balance was real and irreversible. Indigenous peoples moved from being subjects of constitutional discussion to being participants in it. The principle that Canada's constitutional framework must include Indigenous consent -- not just Indigenous accommodation -- was established as a political reality, even if it has not yet been fully realized in law.</p>
              </div>

              <p>The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP), launched in 1991 partly in response to the Oka Crisis and the Meech Lake failure, produced a five-volume, 4,000-page report in 1996. It recommended fundamental restructuring of the relationship between Indigenous peoples and Canada, including recognition of Indigenous nationhood, a new royal proclamation, and the creation of an Aboriginal parliament. Most of its 440 recommendations have never been implemented.</p>

              <p>Beneath every legal argument, every constitutional debate, and every political negotiation lies a simple equation: <strong>land equals money equals power equals control</strong>. The resistance to Indigenous self-determination is not, at its core, about legal complexity or constitutional ambiguity. It is about who controls the resources that generate wealth.</p>

              <p>Canada sits atop one of the richest resource bases on Earth: oil, natural gas, minerals, timber, fresh water, fisheries. The vast majority of these resources are located on or beneath Indigenous traditional territories. Recognizing Indigenous sovereignty over these territories would fundamentally redistribute economic power in Canada. Governments -- federal and provincial -- understand this. So do the corporations that extract these resources.</p>

              <p>The result is a pattern that repeats with depressing predictability: governments fear the precedent that genuine power-sharing would set. They delay negotiations. They fight court decisions. They seek injunctions against Indigenous land defenders. They criminalize protest. They use police forces -- sometimes militarized ones -- to enforce access for resource extraction on disputed lands. And they frame Indigenous resistance as lawlessness rather than as the assertion of legal rights.</p>

              <div class="pull-quote">
                <p class="pull-quote__text">The question is never really about law or jurisdiction. It is about who gets to profit from the land. Every delay, every injunction, every criminalization of protest -- it all comes back to money.</p>

              <p>This is the real barrier to reconciliation. Not a lack of understanding. Not cultural difference. Not legal uncertainty. It is the unwillingness of those who hold economic power to share it -- and the willingness of the state to use force to maintain that imbalance.</p>

                <p class="topic-subtitle">Self-Determination, Not Secession</p>

            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>One of the most persistent misunderstandings in Canadian public discourse is the conflation of Indigenous sovereignty with separatism. When Indigenous peoples assert sovereignty, the response is often fear: fear of territorial loss, of national fragmentation, of a country divided. This fear is based on a fundamental misreading of what sovereignty means in the Indigenous context.</p>

              <p><strong>Indigenous sovereignty is self-determination.</strong> It is the right to govern one's own affairs. It is the recognition of Indigenous legal orders. It is control over the decisions that affect one's community, land, and future. It is a fair share of the prosperity generated from the resources of this land. It is dignity.</p>

              <p>It is <strong>not</strong> secession. It is not the creation of separate countries within Canada. It is not the rejection of the Canadian state. It is the insistence that Indigenous peoples be treated as what they are: the original inhabitants of this land, with inherent rights that predate Confederation and survive it.</p>

              <div class="pull-quote">
                <p class="pull-quote__text">We love this country too. We just want to be respected within it.</p>

                <p class="legal-precedent__citation">Adopted by the UN General Assembly, September 13, 2007; Canada endorsed 2016; UNDRIP Act (Bill C-15), 2021</p>
                <p>UNDRIP affirms the right of Indigenous peoples to self-determination (Article 3), self-government in matters relating to their internal and local affairs (Article 4), and free, prior, and informed consent before states adopt measures affecting them (Articles 19, 32). Critically, Article 46 states that nothing in the Declaration may be interpreted as authorizing the dismemberment of the territorial integrity of sovereign states. Indigenous self-determination under international law is explicitly not secession.</p>
              </div>

              <p>Sovereignty, in the Indigenous understanding, is relational. It is not about building walls but about building relationships -- between peoples, between governments, between legal traditions. It asks Canada to become what it claims to be: a partnership of peoples, not a hierarchy in which one nation rules and all others submit.</p>

                <p class="topic-subtitle">Law Before Canada, Beyond Colonial Courts</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="topic-content">
              <p>If Canada refuses to recognize Indigenous law, then how can Indigenous self-government exist in any meaningful way? This is the question that lies at the end of every discussion about sovereignty, governance, and reconciliation. And it points to what may be the most important frontier in the relationship between Indigenous peoples and the Canadian state: the <strong>revitalization and recognition of Indigenous legal orders</strong>.</p>

              <p>Indigenous law is not a theory. It is not a metaphor. It is a body of law that existed for thousands of years before European contact and continues to exist today. It governs relationships between people and the land, between communities and their members, between human beings and the natural world. It is law rooted in <strong>relationship, responsibility, and balance</strong> rather than in punishment, property, and hierarchy.</p>

              <div class="key-concept">
                <p class="key-concept__label">Key Concept</p>
                <h3 class="key-concept__title">Indigenous Legal Orders</h3>
                <p>Indigenous legal orders are complete systems of law -- not customs, not traditions, not cultural practices, but law. They include principles for governance, dispute resolution, resource management, family relations, and territorial stewardship. Institutions like the University of Victoria's Indigenous Law Research Unit have documented these systems across dozens of nations. The challenge is not proving that Indigenous law exists; it is persuading the Canadian state to recognize legal authority that does not derive from, and is not subordinate to, Canadian law.</p>
              </div>

              <p>The recognition of Indigenous law would not replace Canadian law. It would create space for legal pluralism -- a framework in which multiple legal traditions coexist and interact, each with its own sphere of authority. This is not unprecedented: Canada already operates under two European legal traditions (common law and civil law in Quebec). The recognition of Indigenous legal orders would add a third pillar, one that predates the other two by millennia.</p>

                <p class="primary-source__text">"Indigenous legal traditions are a living reality in Canada. They are not merely historical artifacts or cultural curiosities.

              <p>This is where the conversation is heading. Past the Sixties Scoop. Past the governance conflicts. Past the court decisions. Past the crises and the confrontations. Toward a future in which Indigenous law stands alongside Canadian law -- not as a concession, not as accommodation, but as the recognition of something that was always there, something that survived every attempt to destroy it, something that endures.</p>

                  What is the difference between Indian Act governance and hereditary governance in Indigenous communities?
                </button>
                <div class="faq-answer" role="region">
                  <p>Two governance systems coexist in many Indigenous communities. <strong>Indian Act governance</strong> was imposed by Canada in 1876 and operates through elected band councils on reserves under federal law, with two- or three-year election cycles and authority limited to what the Indian Act permits. <strong>Hereditary or traditional governance</strong> predates colonization and is rooted in Indigenous law, kinship systems, and territorial responsibility -- it is often matriarchal, with leadership passed through clans and validated by ceremony and community consensus.</p>
                  <p>Conflict arises when Canada recognizes only the Indian Act system and disregards hereditary authority. This was starkly demonstrated during the Wet'suwet'en pipeline crisis of 2020, when elected band councils consented to a pipeline but hereditary chiefs -- the traditional authority over unceded territory -- refused. The Supreme Court of Canada recognized Wet'suwet'en hereditary governance in <em>Delgamuukw v. British Columbia</em> (1997), yet the federal government continues to treat Indian Act councils as the primary authority.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer" role="region">
                  <p>The <strong>Sixties Scoop</strong> refers to the mass removal of Indigenous children from their families by provincial child welfare agencies, beginning in the late 1950s and escalating through the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. As residential schools began to close, child removal continued the same policy of cultural erasure through a different mechanism -- children were placed in foster care or adopted into non-Indigenous families across Canada, the United States, and overseas.</p>
                  <p>Tens of thousands of children were affected. Many had their <strong>names, birth dates, and identities altered</strong> to prevent reunification with their families. The Sixties Scoop caused profound intergenerational trauma including loss of language, cultural identity, family connection, and belonging, with effects that continue to reverberate through Indigenous communities today. A class-action settlement in 2017 acknowledged the harm, but the full cost of what was taken -- childhood, family, language, ceremony -- can never be fully compensated.</p>

                  What does Indigenous sovereignty mean, and does it imply secession from Canada?
                </button>
                <div class="faq-answer" role="region">
                  <p><strong>Indigenous sovereignty means self-determination</strong> -- the right of Indigenous peoples to govern their own affairs, apply their own laws, control their own lands and resources, and participate fairly in the prosperity of the country. It does <strong>not</strong> mean secession from Canada.</p>
                  <p>Indigenous sovereignty movements seek self-rule within Canada: the recognition of Indigenous legal orders, respect for treaty relationships, fair resource sharing, and the dignity of being treated as founding peoples rather than subjects of colonial administration. As expressed by Indigenous leaders: "We love this country too. We just want to be respected within it."</p>
                  <p>This understanding is consistent with the <strong>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)</strong>, which Canada endorsed in 2016 and legislated through the UNDRIP Act in 2021. UNDRIP Article 46 explicitly states that nothing in the Declaration authorizes the dismemberment of the territorial integrity of sovereign states. Indigenous self-determination under international law is explicitly not secession.</p>

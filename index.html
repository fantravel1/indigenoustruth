These decrees, including the 1455 Romanus Pontifex and the 1493 Inter Caetera, were used to justify the colonization of Indigenous lands across the Americas, Africa, and Asia. In Canada, the doctrine was incorporated into British and later Canadian law, forming the legal basis for the Crown's assertion of sovereignty over Indigenous territories. The doctrine has been widely condemned by Indigenous leaders, legal scholars, and human rights organizations as a racist and illegitimate foundation for land dispossession. In 2023, the Vatican formally repudiated the Doctrine of Discovery, though Indigenous communities continue to call for its removal from Canadian and international legal frameworks."

The explicit purpose of the system was to forcibly assimilate Indigenous children by separating them from their families, communities, languages, and cultural practices. Over 150,000 First Nations, Métis, and Inuit children were placed in these schools, where many suffered severe physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, malnutrition, and neglect. Thousands of children died while in the care of residential schools, and ongoing investigations have revealed unmarked burial sites at former school locations across the country. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, which concluded in 2015, determined that the residential school system constituted cultural genocide against Indigenous peoples."

Chaired by Justice Murray Sinclair, the TRC spent six years documenting the experiences of residential school survivors through testimony, research, and community hearings across the country. The Commission collected more than 7,000 survivor statements and produced a comprehensive final report in 2015 that included 94 Calls to Action directed at all levels of government, educational institutions, churches, and Canadian society. The TRC concluded that Canada's residential school system constituted cultural genocide and called for fundamental changes in the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians. The Commission's work remains a cornerstone of ongoing reconciliation efforts, though many of the 94 Calls to Action have yet to be fully implemented."

                    "@type": "Answer",
                    "text": "Unceded territory refers to land that was never surrendered, relinquished, or legally transferred by Indigenous peoples to the Crown or the Canadian government through treaty, agreement, or any other legitimate process. Large portions of Canada, particularly in British Columbia and parts of Quebec and the Atlantic provinces, are considered unceded Indigenous territory because no treaties were signed between the Indigenous nations and colonial or Canadian governments. The acknowledgement of unceded territory challenges the assumption that the Crown holds legitimate sovereignty over all Canadian land and raises fundamental questions about land rights, resource extraction, and Indigenous self-determination. Canadian courts, including the Supreme Court of Canada in decisions such as Delgamuukw v. British Columbia (1997) and Tsilhqot'in Nation v. British Columbia (2014), have affirmed that Aboriginal title can exist on unceded lands. Understanding unceded territory is essential to meaningful reconciliation because it recognizes the ongoing rights and jurisdiction of Indigenous peoples over their ancestral lands."

The Calls to Action cover a wide range of areas including child welfare, education, language and culture, health, justice, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), and commemoration. Key recommendations include reforming the child welfare system to reduce the overrepresentation of Indigenous children in care, establishing Indigenous language programs, requiring age-appropriate curriculum about residential schools in all Canadian schools, and addressing the overrepresentation of Indigenous people in the criminal justice system. As of 2024, only a fraction of the 94 Calls to Action have been fully implemented, prompting ongoing criticism from Indigenous leaders and advocacy organizations. The Calls to Action continue to serve as a critical framework for measuring Canada's progress toward genuine reconciliation with Indigenous peoples."

                            <p>The Doctrine of Discovery is a set of legal principles rooted in 15th-century papal bulls issued by the Catholic Church that granted European monarchs the right to claim lands inhabited by non-Christian peoples. These decrees, including the 1455 <em>Romanus Pontifex</em> and the 1493 <em>Inter Caetera</em>, were used to justify the colonization of Indigenous lands across the Americas, Africa, and Asia. In Canada, the doctrine was incorporated into British and later Canadian law, forming the legal basis for the Crown's assertion of sovereignty over Indigenous territories. The doctrine has been widely condemned by Indigenous leaders, legal scholars, and human rights organizations as a racist and illegitimate foundation for land dispossession. In 2023, the Vatican formally repudiated the Doctrine of Discovery, though Indigenous communities continue to call for its removal from Canadian and international legal frameworks.</p>

                            <p>Residential schools were a network of government-funded, church-run boarding institutions that operated in Canada from the 1880s until the last school closed in 1996. The explicit purpose of the system, as articulated by officials such as Duncan Campbell Scott, was to "kill the Indian in the child" by forcibly assimilating Indigenous children into Euro-Canadian society. Over 150,000 First Nations, M&eacute;tis, and Inuit children were placed in these schools, where many suffered severe physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, malnutrition, and neglect. Thousands of children died while in the care of residential schools, and ongoing investigations have revealed unmarked burial sites at former school locations across the country. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, which concluded in 2015, determined that the residential school system constituted cultural genocide against Indigenous peoples.</p>

                            <p>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) of Canada was established in 2008 as part of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, the largest class-action settlement in Canadian history. Chaired by Justice Murray Sinclair, the TRC spent six years documenting the experiences of residential school survivors through testimony, research, and community hearings across the country. The Commission collected more than 7,000 survivor statements and produced a comprehensive final report in 2015 that included 94 Calls to Action directed at all levels of government, educational institutions, churches, and Canadian society. The TRC concluded that Canada's residential school system constituted cultural genocide and called for fundamental changes in the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians. The Commission's work remains a cornerstone of ongoing reconciliation efforts, though many of the 94 Calls to Action have yet to be fully implemented.</p>

                            <p>Unceded territory refers to land that was never surrendered, relinquished, or legally transferred by Indigenous peoples to the Crown or the Canadian government through treaty, agreement, or any other legitimate process. Large portions of Canada, particularly in British Columbia and parts of Quebec and the Atlantic provinces, are considered unceded Indigenous territory because no treaties were signed between the Indigenous nations and colonial or Canadian governments. The acknowledgement of unceded territory challenges the assumption that the Crown holds legitimate sovereignty over all Canadian land and raises fundamental questions about land rights, resource extraction, and Indigenous self-determination. Canadian courts, including the Supreme Court of Canada in decisions such as <em>Delgamuukw v. British Columbia</em> (1997) and <em>Tsilhqot'in Nation v. British Columbia</em> (2014), have affirmed that Aboriginal title can exist on unceded lands. Understanding unceded territory is essential to meaningful reconciliation because it recognizes the ongoing rights and jurisdiction of Indigenous peoples over their ancestral lands.</p>

                            <p>The 94 Calls to Action are a series of directives issued by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada in 2015, outlining concrete steps to address the legacy of residential schools and advance reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians. The Calls to Action cover a wide range of areas including child welfare, education, language and culture, health, justice, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), and commemoration. Key recommendations include reforming the child welfare system to reduce the overrepresentation of Indigenous children in care, establishing Indigenous language programs, requiring age-appropriate curriculum about residential schools in all Canadian schools, and addressing the overrepresentation of Indigenous people in the criminal justice system. As of 2024, only a fraction of the 94 Calls to Action have been fully implemented, prompting ongoing criticism from Indigenous leaders and advocacy organizations. The Calls to Action continue to serve as a critical framework for measuring Canada's progress toward genuine reconciliation with Indigenous peoples.</p>
